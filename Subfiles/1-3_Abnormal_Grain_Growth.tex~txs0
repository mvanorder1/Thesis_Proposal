Magnetostrictive Fe–Ga alloys (Galfenol) have promising attributes for application to sensors, actua- tors and energy harvesting as Clark et al. first reported in 2000 [1]. Single-crystal Galfenol has a body-centered
cubic (bcc) crystal structure, and along the \hkl<100> crystal orientations, it exhibits saturation magnetostriction of $\sim$400 ppm in low applied magnetic fields of $\sim$200 Oe. It also has a mechanical strength of $\sim$500 MPa, which is high relative to more costly rare earth magnetostrictive materials such as Terfenol-D alloys which exhibit giant magnetostriction ($\gtrsim$1600 ppm) but are brittle and require much higher magnetic fields ($\gtrsim$1000 Oe) for saturation [1–3]. The large magnetostriction and easy magnetization in single-crystal Galfenol alloys occur along the \hkl<100> orientation. It is thus desirable to obtain the \hkl<100> orientation in textured polycrystalline Galfenol, with the goal of providing enhanced mechanical properties and lower cost than single-crystal material, with similar magnetostrictive strain. 

Two viable approaches have been employed to fabricate highly texturedFe–Ga alloys [4,5].One isadirectional solidification growth process, and the other is thermomechanical processing involving deformation via rolling and recrystallization through grain growth and orienta- tion mechanisms. Galfenol rods grown by the directional solidification process have strong crystallite textures with \hkl<100> preferred orientation aligned 14$^{\circ}$ off from the rod direction and a maximum magnetostriction ($\lambda_{\parallel}$)of 271 ppm under compression [4]. In other works, Kellogg et al. reported that binary Fe$_{0.83}$Ga$_{0.17}$ with a somewhat dispersed \hkl{001}\hkl<100> texture along rolling direction (RD) exhibited magnetostrictive strain of $\sim$160 ppm as a consequence of rolling and annealing at 1100$^{\circ}$C for 4 h[5]. Texture annealing of Fe$_{0.85}$Ga$_{0.15}$ alloy with 1 mol.\% NbC at 1150–1300$^{\circ}$C for 24 h changed the texture from a strong $\alpha$-fiber texture \hkl<110>$\parallel$RD in as-rolled sheet to a preferred texture with \hkl<100> orientation [6]. The authors did not report the magnetostriction values; however, an estimated of lower than 135 ppm can be made based on their electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) data and the nominal saturation value in a single crystal with the same composition. In our prior work, we have demonstrated the texture development of Goss \hkl{011}\hkl<100> texture through secondary recrystallization by using NbC particles as an inhibitor of normal grain growth(NGG) [7].
