Magnetostrictive Fe–Ga alloys (Galfenol) have promising attributes for application to sensors, actuators and energy harvesting as Clark \etal first reported in 2000\cite{clark2000magnetostrictive}. Single-crystal Galfenol has a body-centered
cubic (bcc) crystal structure, and along the \hkl<100> crystal orientations, it exhibits saturation magnetostriction of $\sim$400 ppm in low applied magnetic fields of $\sim$200 Oe. It also has a mechanical strength of $\sim$500 MPa, which is high relative to more costly rare earth magnetostrictive materials such as Terfenol-D alloys which exhibit giant magnetostriction ($\gtrsim$1600 ppm) but are brittle and require much higher magnetic fields ($\gtrsim$1000 Oe) for saturation\cite{clark2000magnetostrictive,Clark2003,Guruswamy2000}. The large magnetostriction and easy magnetization in single-crystal Galfenol alloys occur along the \hkl<100> orientation. It is thus desirable to obtain the \hkl<100> orientation in textured polycrystalline Galfenol, with the goal of providing enhanced mechanical properties and lower cost than single-crystal material, with similar magnetostrictive strain.

Two viable approaches have been employed to fabricate highly textured Fe–Ga alloys\cite{srisukhumbowornchai2001large,kellogg2003texture}. One is a directional solidification growth process, and the other is thermomechanical processing involving deformation via rolling and recrystallization through grain growth and

orientation mechanisms. Currently, stress-annealed and field-annealed samples are first rolled into sheets from ingots, and then atmospherically annealed to develop large grains on the sample surface area by utilizing the abnormal grain growth (AGG) phenomenon. 


AGG is often detrimental in piezoelectric ceramics because it lowers the hardness and the larger developed grain sizes lead to degradation of the piezoelectric effect.\cite{Bing2014} For our application goals, we use AGG to our advantage by targeting Goss \hkl{110} and Cube \hkl{100} textures to obtain one and two directions, respectively, of easy magnetic axes and high magnetostriction in the plane of rolled sheets. This process avoids lengthy and expensive single-crystal growth methods while still producing Galfenol with sufficient magnetostrictive properties for device application. We have been studying the development of Goss- and Cube-textured Galfenol rolled sheet as a low-cost alternative to magnetostrictive single crystal Galfenol for several years. To optimize specific grain growth, we have  incorporated pinning particles during the rolling process, experimented with different annealing temperatures and times, and modified the annealing environment.\cite{Na2007b,Na2008,Na2009,Na2012} 

Fig. \ref{fig:AGG-diagram} depicts the more successful annealing conditions we have tested. As-rolled polycrystalline Galfenol (left image) exhibits a strong $\gamma$-fiber and weak rotated cube textures, and starts with an $\alpha$-iron (B2) structure. A partly grown Goss texture developed over $\sim$39$\%$ of the sample surface area during a 3h argon-anneal (upper right image) due to grain boundary energy alone. This is because large inert argon particles only adsorb to the Galfenol surface, rather than penetrating the lattice and causing surface-energy-modifying segregation. We have also demonstrated that small variations in surface energy have a significant impact of the development of texture.\cite{Chun2010,Na2012b} The two lower right images show AGG with fully developed \hkl(001) and \hkl(011) grains over 90-95$ \% $ of the sample surface.

\end{wrapfigure}
AGG of (011) grains is very reproducible (insensitive to small variations in anneal conditions), while the development of (001) grains is challenging to produce/reproduce (highly sensitive to anneal conditions). Saturation magnetostriction values equal to 90$ \% $ and 84$ \% $ of single crystal \hkl(100) values for alloy of the same composition were measured in sulfur-annealed samples with \hkl(001) and \hkl(011) grain growth, respectively.  

Developing protocols for making thin sheet Galfenol with Goss or Cube textures has been challenging because the mechanisms that regulate grain boundary mobility and texture development in these alloys are not well understood. Modelling techniques that examine grain boundary interactions, coincident site lattice (CSL) and high energy grain boundary (HEGB), have been investigated to understand AGG mechanisms. These techniques were able to sufficiently describe abnormally grown Goss grains in \fegacomp(x=19)+1.0 mol\% NbC rolled sheets, but mechanisms for abnormally grown Cube-grains are still not known.\cite{Chun2010} We believe that these models are insufficient because they do not incorporate extraneous driving forces caused by the control of surface energy from atmospheric annealing conditions, as described by Kramer \etal 
By characterizing the surface energy of specific Galfenol grains, we can develop a more accurate thermodynamic-based framework for modeling AGG and texture development that will be used to understand why a high temperature atmospheric anneal transforms myriad crystallite grains into the highly textured, single-crystal-like polycrysalline material. 

%Figure \ref{fig:AGG-diagram} results are the first and only that we know of to employ concepts that date back to the mid-1960’s \cite{Walter1965,dunn1962surface,waeckerle1993effect} for developing AGG in irons, Fe-Si and silicon-steels together with Kramer’s work in the 1990’s\cite{Kramer1992} on control of surface energy to develop Cube texture in Fe-Si. Our research hypothesis is motivated by our desire to understand the physical metallurgy that lead to these results and be able to routinely reproduce these results in rare-earth-free anisotropic alloys.

The dramatic difference in abnormal grain growth (AGG) and texture between the result in the top right image and the results in the two lower right images was accomplished by building on empirical insights from studies of Fe and Fe-Si alloys in which control of surface energy was used to regulate grain growth and ultimately to produce Cube-textured material.\cite{Walter1965,dunn1962surface,waeckerle1993effect,Kramer1992}

%In other works, Kellogg et al. reported that binary Fe$_{0.83}$Ga$_{0.17}$ with a somewhat dispersed \hkl{001}\hkl<100> texture along rolling direction (RD) exhibited magnetostrictive strain of $\sim$160 ppm as a consequence of rolling and annealing at 1100$^{\circ}$C for 4 h\cite{kellogg2003texture}. Texture annealing of Fe$_{0.85}$Ga$_{0.15}$ alloy with 1 mol.\% NbC at 1150–1300$^{\circ}$C for 24 h changed the texture from a strong $\alpha$-fiber texture \hkl<110>$\parallel$RD in as-rolled sheet to a preferred texture with \hkl<100> orientation\cite{srisukhumbowornchai2004crystallographic}. In our prior work, we have demonstrated the texture development of Goss \hkl{011}\hkl<100> texture through secondary recrystallization by using NbC particles as an inhibitor of normal grain growth(NGG) \cite{Na2009}.

%The importance of Alfenol surface energy lies in the Aerosmart Lab's need for more efficient energy harvesting materials. Goss-textured Alfenol can reach magnetostrictive constants of ~184 ppm, and the elusive Cube-textured Alfenol would reach even higher magnetostriction values due to the additional direction of easy magnetic axes. An added benefit of developing a Cube texture is that it will make feasible use of magnetic field annealing to maximize performance\cite{Yoo2009,Yoo2008} and thereby eliminate the need for stress annealing or use of pre-stress components in the design of devices that use these materials\cite{Restorff2006,Summers2009}. Clearly, Alfenol AGG is affected differently than Galfenol under sulfur concentrations. This must be due to the differences in orientation-dependent surface energy between Galfenol and Alfenol.

%\textbf{Interface Science and Composites (Chapter 3: Solid-Liquid Interface), by Soo-Jin Park and Min-Kang Seo\cite{Park2011a}}


Thermodynamically, the physical origin of the surface free energy is the excess Gibbs free energy of matter at the interface. Atoms or molecules exposed at an interface are surrounded by fewer neighbors, such as solid, liquid, and gas phases, resulting in an anisotropic distribution of these neighbors, which is the characteristic of a surface. Interaction energy must be shared between phases with the neighboring molecules. Hence, the surface free energy, $\gamma$, represents the rate of change of the Gibbs free energy of the system with respect to the area, $A$, at a constant pressure and temperature\cite{Chattoraj2012}:
\begin{equation}\label{SFE}
	\gamma = \left(\frac{\partial G}{\partial A}\right)_{T,P}
\end{equation}
In principle, Equation \ref{SFE} can be used to calculate the surface tension of a condensed phase held together by the long-range forces. 

The interaction of a liquid with a solid is characterized by the term "wetting." Wetting can be understood as the spreading of a liquid over a solid surface, the penetration of a liquid into porous materials, or the displacement of one liquid by another. This phenomenon can help to characterize a surface, and to determine the interaction between a solid and a liquid. 

One way to quantify a liquid's surface wetting characteristics is to measure the contact angle of a drop of liquid placed on the surface of an object. The contact angle formed by the solid-liquid and liquid-vapor interfaces are measured from the side of the liquid. Liquids wet surfaces when the contact angle is less than 90\degree. For a penetrant material to be effective, the contact angle should be as small as possible. In fact, the contact angle for most liquid penetrants approach 0\degree. 

The wetting ability of a liquid is a function of the surface energy of the solid-vapor interface, the liquid-gas interface, and the solid-liquid interface. The surface energy across an interface or the surface tension at the interface is a measure of the energy required to form the unit area of a new surface at the interface. The intermolecular bonds, or cohesive forces, between the molecules of a liquid cause surface tension. When the liquid encounters another substance, there is usually an attraction between the two materials. The adhesive forces between the liquid and the second substance will compete against the cohesive forces of the liquid.  Liquids with strong cohesive bonds and weaker adhesive forces will tend to bead-up or form a droplet when in contact with another material. Liquids with relatively weak cohesive bonds and a strong attraction to another material, or the desire to create adhesive bonds, will tend to spread over the material, such is the case with water droplets on high-surface energy metal substrates.

Depending on the thermodynamic state or the hydrodynamic status of the liquid drop in which the contact angle is measured, two types of contact angels can be defined. If the contact angle is measured when either the liquid drop contines to spread or when its thermodynamic state conditions continue to change, the measured contact angle is termed the dynamic contact angle. However, if the contact angle is measured under conditions in which the liquid drop is stationary and the surrounding conditions in which the liquid drop is stationary and the surrounding conditions are in the steady state, the measured contact angle is known as the static/equilibrium contact angle. The contact angle technique is chosen for studies of the wettability phenomena owing to its simplicity.

The solid-liquid interface plays a fundamental role in diverse fields and helps with an understanding of physical phenomena and structural knowledge of the interface at the atomic scale. Fields of interest include catalysis, lubrication, electrochemistry, colloidal systems, biological reactions, and, most relevantly, crystal growth. Therefore, unravelling the atomic structure at the solid-liquid interface is one of the major challenges. 


Contact angle measurements, as described by Thomas Young in 1805, remain the most accurate method for determining the interaction energy between a liquid (L) and a solid (S) in a condensed state at the minimum equilibrium distance of S and L. This is defined geometrically as the angle formed by a liquid at the three-phase boundary, where vapor, liquid, and solid intersect. It measures the result of liquid cohesion energy, $\gamma_{L}$ and the energy of adhesion between a liquid and solid. Young described the equilibrium contact angle at the three-phase boundary in terms of the vectorial sum, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:ca-vector}, resulting in an equilibrium force balance. The famous Young's equation is derived from the Gibbs free energy at equilibrium, as seen from the result of Equation \ref{young_eqn}. 



\begin{equation}\label{young_eqn}
	\boxed{\gamma_{SV} =\gamma_{SL}-\gamma_{LV}\cos\theta}

We attempt to model a new contact angle method based on Equation \ref{young_eqn} in Section \ref{section2}
