\subsection{Liquid Gallium drop method}

\textbf{2.1 Surface energy measurement}
There are currently no experimental methods available to measure surface energies associated with different crystallographic orientations of metals. High temperature methods involving cylindrical metal samples and destructive methods involving drop shape samples of a targeted liquid metal near the melting point are available for measuring surface energy of amorphous and isotropic solid metals.\cite{Egry2010,Aqra2011,Cao2011} For our research, however, we require knowledge of orientation-, morphology- and composition-dependent surface energies for validation of DFT results and for use in abnormal grain growth simulations. For glass and polymeric solids with relatively low surface energies, the water-drop method has been shown to be effective for the determination of surface energy at room temperature.\cite{Ahadian2010,Kwok2000,Tavana2005} We attempted to use this approach for contact angle measurements on large 17.9$\%$Ga Galfenol single crystal samples with \hkl(001), \hkl(011) and \hkl(111) grains with facilities at NIST. 


\textcolor{red}{\textbf{INCORRECT STATEMENT}: However, non-physical trends in the results lead to the conclusion that disruption of strong inter-atomic and molecular bonds with high coordination numbers at the free substrate surface (an intrinsic property of a metal substrate[75,76,77]) interfered with the water drop surface tension and resultant water drop-substrate contact angles.}
%TODO: Finish writing about why the water drop method will not work for metals.

Water will completely wet the high surface energy of metals.
%TODO: Explain why water completely wets a high energy surface

We proposed using a liquid gallium droplet to measure the orientation-dependent surface energy of high-surface energy metals, like Galfenol and Alfenol. This project has been funded by the \NSF.

\subsection{Results and Presentations}

%TODO: Explain why this method is not possible from a fundamental thermodynamic position (ie using one thermodynamic equilibirum and plugging it in to another equation at thermodynamic equilibrium). Should be able to go from one thermodynamic equilibrium equation to another, but that is not the case here. The method could still be feasible if more terms (\gamSL between liquid-Ga and solid) were known
