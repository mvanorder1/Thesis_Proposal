The interactions of water with a low-energy and high-energy solid surface differ significantly. The relative energy of a solid compared to a liquid has to do with the bulk nature of the solid. Solids with weak molecular crystals (e.g., fluorocarbons, hydrocarbons, etc.) where the molecules are held together by weak physical forces (e.g., van der Waals and hydrogen bonds) are termed low-energy solids. A very low input of energy is required to break these solids, thus they typically have surface energy $<$72 mJ/m$^2$.  Metals, glasses, and ceramics are known as "hard solids" because the chemical bonds that hold them together (e.g., covalent, ionic, or metallic) are very strong. Thus, these surfaces are high-energy because of the high amount of energy needed to break these solids to make two new surfaces, (e.g. see Equation \ref{SFE} in Section \ref{define-surf-energy}). High energy solids typically have surfaces energies $>$72 mJ/m$^2$.  The threshold between these two types of surfaces lies in their surface energy values relative to the surface tension of water, $\sim$72 mJ/m$^2$. Water tends to partially wet a low energy surface and completely wet a high energy surface based on how much lesser or greater the surface energy of the solid is compared to water, respectively. 

I will investigate two approaches to overcome the challenges involved in measuring the surface energy of metals using contact angle measurements. The first will study temperature variations of Galfenol surface energy using a droplet of gallium as the probe liquid. Gallium is a liquid with a surface tension at room temperature that is roughly one order of magnitude higher than that of water: $\gamma_{Ga}\sim$715.3 mJ/m$^2$. It is expected that a measurable contact angle will form between Galfenol and liquid gallium, and this information will be incorporated into an analytical model to extract the solid surface energy. The second will build on the two-liquid-phase technique to form a measurable water contact angle on the surface of Galfenol. To supplement this measurement, Galfenol samples will be patterned with a planned roughness to increase the water contact angle and properly determine the Young's contact angle to be used in surface energy calculations. Both experiments will use highly Goss textured Galfenol as well as single-crystal Galfenol samples to assure isotropic crystal orientation for contact angle measurements. 

Once experimental results are validated with published values, DFT predictions of the surface energy associated with different crystallographic orientations in Fe-Ga and Fe-Al will be tested and verified. This task and the resultant capability should have broad applicability beyond the needs of this proposal for extension to polycrystalline textured metals and thin films.
%This method has the potential to become a valuable tool for obtaining empirical surface energy data associated with AGG of Galfenol grains as well as other metallurgical studies.

%TODO: Explain why this method is not possible from a fundamental thermodynamic position (ie using one thermodynamic equilibirum and plugging it in to another equation at thermodynamic equilibrium). Should be able to go from one thermodynamic equilibrium equation to another, but that is not the case here. The method could still be feasible if more terms (\gamSL between liquid-Ga and solid) were known
