abstract = {Ultrafast laser techniques have revealed extraordinary spin dynamics in magnetic materials that equilibrium descriptions of magnetism cannot explain. Particularly important for future applications is understanding non-equilibrium spin dynamics following laser excitation on the nanoscale, yet the limited spatial resolution of optical laser techniques has impeded such nanoscale studies. Here we present ultrafast diffraction experiments with an X-ray laser that probes the nanoscale spin dynamics following optical laser excitation in the ferrimagnetic alloy GdFeCo, which exhibits macroscopic all-optical switching. Our study reveals that GdFeCo displays nanoscale chemical and magnetic inhomogeneities that affect the spin dynamics. In particular, we observe Gd spin reversal in Gd-rich nanoregions within the first picosecond driven by the non-local transfer of angular momentum from larger adjacent Fe-rich nanoregions. These results suggest that a magnetic material's microstructure can be engineered to control transient laser-excited spins, potentially allowing faster ({\~{}} 1 ps) spin reversal than in present technologies.},

The monotonic decrease of the surface energies of both facets with increasing temperature is mostly due to lattice vibrations and magnetic disorder.

The wetting states and contact angles of the underwater oil droplet on different hydrophobic surfaces were simulated. The simulation results showed that there were three kinds of equilibrium states on the pillar surfaces: the Wenzel, cross, and Cassie states. Moreover, the equilibrium state of the underwater oil droplet transformed from a Wenzel to Cassie state when the water contact angle decreased. The contact angle of the underwater oil droplet increased as the water contact angle decreased. Furthermore, the wetting behaviors of the underwater oil droplet on rough polytetrafluoroethylene and silicon surfaces were studied in experiments.

abstract = {Texture evolution and the distribution of Goss orientation in polycrystalline Fe–Ga alloy were investi-gated as a series of rolling and subsequent annealing pro-cesses were used to develop highly textured rolled sheet. A dramatic change from the random nature of the as-rolled and primary recrystallized texture is observed when careful control of atmosphere and temperature during anneal leads to development of a sharp Goss orientation over up to 98 {\%} of the surface of a sample during secondary recrystalliza-tion. In this work, grain boundary properties in local areas surrounding Goss grains are investigated and the evolution of Goss orientation is traced through the different stages of alloy processing using electron backscatter diffraction analysis. To evaluate the evolution of grains with Goss orientation, {\{}011{\}} grains are selected and separated from other texture components at each processing step and sta-tistical analysis used to correlate the structural inheritance chain of Goss-oriented grains. The four processing stages considered are the alloy after hot rolling, the as-rolled alloy (i.e., after subsequent warm and cold rolling), the alloy after an initial anneal during which primary recrystalliza-tion occurs, and the alloy after final anneals in which secondary recrystallization with abnormal grain growth occurs. Analysis of Goss grain orientation probability dis-tribution functions after primary and secondary recrystal-lization convincingly demonstrates that the orientation of the abnormally grown Goss texture that develops during secondary recrystallization is determined by the orientation of Goss components that develop during the primary recrystallization stage of alloy processing.},

While they are not as strong as Coulombic or H-bonding interactions, they are always present and can be important both at small and large separations. van der Waals interaction between macroscopic particles and surfaces is large, even when the bodies are not in contact. In a medium, the interaction strength is reduced by about an order of magnitude and under certain conditions, it can become repulsive. The chapter begins by deriving the van der Waals interaction energies in a vacuum for pairs of bodies of different geometries. The chapter explains the van der Waals force laws for bodies of different geometries. It then discusses the strength of van der Wall forces between bodies in a vacuum or air. The Lifshitz theory of van der Waals forces is presented, and the concept of particle–surface interactions is explained. The nonretarded Hamaker constants are calculated on the basis of the Lifshitz theory. The chapter also explains the concepts of surface and adhesion energies, surface energies of metals, and forces between surfaces with adsorbed layers.},

abstract = {This article reviews the current understanding of the electrical properties of the grain boundaries of acceptor-doped zirconia and ceria, however, with an emphasis on the grain-boundary defect structure. From an electrical point of view, a grain boundary consists of a grain-boundary core and two adjacent space-charge layers. The grain-boundary cores of acceptor-doped zirconia and ceria are positively charged, probably owing to the oxygen vacancy enrichment there. Oxygen vacancies are therefore depleted in the space-charge layer. The grain-boundary conductivities of acceptor-doped zirconia and ceria are at least two orders of magnitude lower than the corresponding bulk values, depending on temperature and dopant level. Such a phenomenon is due to the facts: (1) that oxygen vacancies are severely depleted in the space-charge layer, and (2) that the grain-boundary impurity phase blocks the ionic transport across the grain boundaries by decreasing the conduction path width and constricting current lines. In materials of high purity, the effect of the space-charge depletion layer is dominant; however, in materials of normal purity, the effect of the grain-boundary impurity phase is dominant. A Schottky barrier model satisfactorily explains all the phenomenological observations of the grain-boundary electrical properties of materials of high purity, and experimental evidence soundly supports the model. Various factors (alumina addition and grain size) influencing the grain-boundary electrical properties are discussed, and some special aspects of nanocrystalline materials are highlighted. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The Cassie-Baxter model is widely used to predict the apparent contact angles obtained on composite (solid-liquid-air) superhydrophobic interfaces. However, the validity of this model has been repeatedly challenged by various research groups because of its inherent inability to predict contact angle hysteresis. In our recent work, we have developed robust omniphobic surfaces which repel a wide range of liquids. An interesting corollary of constructing such surfaces is that it becomes possible to directly image the solid-liquid-air triple-phase contact line on a composite interface, using an electron microscope with non-volatile organic liquids or curable polymers. Here, we fabricate a range of model superoleophobic surfaces with controlled surface topography in order to correlate the details of the local texture with the experimentally observed apparent contact angles. Based on these experiments, in conjunction with numerical simulations, we modify the classical Cassie-Baxter relation to include a local differential texture parameter which enables us to quantitatively predict the apparent advancing and receding contact angles, as well as contact angle hysteresis. This quantitative prediction also allows us to provide an a priori estimation of roll-off angles for a given textured substrate. Using this understanding we design model substrates that display extremely small or extremely large roll-off angles, as well as surfaces that demonstrate direction-dependent wettability, through a systematic control of surface topography and connectivity. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {This chapter elaborates the differences between intermolecular, interparticle, and intersurface forces. Properties of solids and liquids are determined mainly by the molecular binding force or the strength of the interactions. The long-range nature of the interactions, such as the exact distance dependence of the force laws plays only a minor role. This chapter investigates in detail the interactions between spheres and particles whose radii are much larger than interatomic spacings. The chapter lists the most common forces encountered between macroscopic particles and extended surfaces interacting in liquids. It also summarizes the special features of different interactions. The chapter illustrates some commonly occurring intermolecular and intersurface potential functions and the different effects they can have on molecule–molecule and particle–particle interactions. The chapter relates the pair potentials between small molecules to those between molecules and surfaces, and between large particles of different geometries. The chapter also explains in detail the concepts related to size effects on interparticle interaction potentials, surface-area-to-volume scaling effects, and dynamic and nonequilibrium effects.},

abstract = {This chapter discusses covalent and Coulomb interactions as the strong forces operating within molecules. Covalent forces tightly bind the atoms together within the molecule. They are of short range, that is, they operate over very short distances of the order of interatomic separations. Covalently bonded atoms make up molecules and crystals with well-defined structures that cannot normally melt or liquify without totally breaking the bonds. They tend to sublimate, decompose, or undergo a chemical reaction above some temperature rather than going through the conventional solid-liquid-gas states that are characteristic of physically bonded molecules. This chapter starts with a discussion on covalent or chemical bonding forces, and the differences between physical and chemical bonds. The chapter then explains Coulomb forces (charge–charge interactions). Concepts of ionic crystals and reference states are explained. The chapter gives detailed discussion on the Born energy as well as solubility of ions in different solvents. The chapter concludes with presenting computer simulations and integral equations of many-body systems.},

abstract = {Iron-Gallium alloys (Galfenol) possess a body centered cubic (BCC) alpha-Fe structure with the gallium atoms substituted throughout the lattice structure. Polycrystalline metals are often isotropic due to their overall random crystallographic orientation, however single crystal and strongly textured polycrystalline BCC metals exhibit a high degree of anisotropy in their physical characteristics. Galfenol has an anisotropic magnetostriction with the maximum performance achieved in the lang100rang direction. Previous field annealing experiments on polycrystalline Galfenol strips have shown a great disparity in the results. This paper uses EBSD to examine the influence of crystal orientation of grains on magnetostriction under various stresses to determine if the disparity is due to the number and/or orientation of the crystals comprising the strip. The saturation magnetostrictions and elastic moduli for each grain are predicted based on the crystal angle measured using EBSD, and the averaged maximum magnetostriction for each sample is calculated with the force balanced between each grain in a sample. The experimental saturation magnetostrictions at 700 Oe agree well with the calculated results. The highest built-in uniaxial anisotropy after magnetic annealing is about 1 kJ/m3 and all the samples in this study showed performance improvement after field annealing.},

It was found that low-rate dynamic contact angles are essentially independent of the velocity of the three-phase contact line and identical to the static advancing angles. The mean contact angles for each liquid were determined by averaging the contact angles at 10 different advancing rates. These angles were used to test different contact angle approaches for solid surface tensions. It was found that these experimental contact angles on the inert solid surface are consistent with the equation of state approach for interfacial tensions.

abstract = {Following pioneering work, solution-processable organic-inorganic hybrid perovskites-such as CH3NH3PbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I)-have attracted attention as light-harvesting materials for mesoscopic solar cells. So far, the perovskite pigment has been deposited in a single step onto mesoporous metal oxide films using a mixture of PbX2 and CH3NH3X in a common solvent. However, the uncontrolled precipitation of the perovskite produces large morphological variations, resulting in a wide spread of photovoltaic performance in the resulting devices, which hampers the prospects for practical applications. Here we describe a sequential deposition method for the formation of the perovskite pigment within the porous metal oxide film. PbI2 is first introduced from solution into a nanoporous titanium dioxide film and subsequently transformed into the perovskite by exposing it to a solution of CH3NH3I. We find that the conversion occurs within the nanoporous host as soon as the two components come into contact, permitting much better control over the perovskite morphology than is possible with the previously employed route. Using this technique for the fabrication of solid-state mesoscopic solar cells greatly increases the reproducibility of their performance and allows us to achieve a power conversion efficiency of approximately 15 per cent (measured under standard AM1.5G test conditions on solar zenith angle, solar light intensity and cell temperature). This two-step method should provide new opportunities for the fabrication of solution-processed photovoltaic cells with unprecedented power conversion efficiencies and high stability equal to or even greater than those of today's best thin-film photovoltaic devices.},

@article{Cognard1984a,
abstract = {Adhesion is a complex subject and is not fully understood as yet. This explains the many different approaches followed in the field. For instance, in physics we calculate the ideal strength (1) and from a mechanics approach the force of adherence (2), while physical chemists try to understand the molecular interactions which are responsible for the adhesion (3). In the first part of this review the more important results obtained from these approaches will be discussed. These results will relate the force of adherence to the energy of adhesion or the substrate surface tension. The middle section is devoted to surface tension on gold and the controversial matter of whether or not gold is wettable. Recent findings on gold wettability will be discussed and it will be shown that contamination by hydrocarbons is not directly related to the apparent hydrophobicity of the metal. The final part of the article discusses experimental results on the strength of adhesive joints between gold surfaces under various stresses. The review concludes with a presentation of the view that slow superficial reconstruction of gold surfaces may be an important reason for the apparent discrepancies in their behaviourwhich have been recorded. Discussion of the various approaches is of necessity somewhat mathematical. The detail has, however, been kept to a minimum and interested readers should consult the references quoted for a fuller treatment. A glossary of terms used has been compiled to assist those readers less conversant with the subject to follow the arguments presented in this article.

abstract = {The chapter discusses the basic concepts of repulsive steric forces and the form, magnitude and range of total intermolecular pair potentials. A strong repulsive force arises when the electron clouds of atoms overlap at very small interatomic distances. This force determines how close two atoms or molecules can ultimately approach each other. The repulsive forces are sometimes referred to as exchange repulsion, hard core repulsion, steric repulsion, and Born repulsion, and they are characterized by having very short ranges and increase very sharply when two molecules come together. These forces belong to the category of quantum mechanical or chemical forces, and there is no general equation for describing their distance dependence. The chapter explains in detail the role of repulsive forces in noncovalently bonded solids. Packing of molecules and particles in solids is also discussed in the chapter. The chapter also elaborates the role of repulsive forces in liquids and the effect of liquid structure on molecular forces.},

abstract = {Ultrafast laser techniques have revealed extraordinary spin dynamics in magnetic materials that equilibrium descriptions of magnetism cannot explain. Particularly important for future applications is understanding non-equilibrium spin dynamics following laser excitation on the nanoscale, yet the limited spatial resolution of optical laser techniques has impeded such nanoscale studies. Here we present ultrafast diffraction experiments with an X-ray laser that probes the nanoscale spin dynamics following optical laser excitation in the ferrimagnetic alloy GdFeCo, which exhibits macroscopic all-optical switching. Our study reveals that GdFeCo displays nanoscale chemical and magnetic inhomogeneities that affect the spin dynamics. In particular, we observe Gd spin reversal in Gd-rich nanoregions within the first picosecond driven by the non-local transfer of angular momentum from larger adjacent Fe-rich nanoregions. These results suggest that a magnetic material's microstructure can be engineered to control transient laser-excited spins, potentially allowing faster ({\~{}} 1 ps) spin reversal than in present technologies.},

abstract = {Contact angle measurements with a large number of liquids on the semi-fluorinated acryl polymer EGC-1700 films are reported. The surface tension was determined to be gammasv=13.84 mJ/m2 from contact angles of octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane (OMCTS) and decamethylcyclopentasiloxane (DMCPS). Inertness of these two liquids makes them ideal for determination of surface tension of low-energy fluoropolymers. On the other hand, contact angles of many other liquids deviated somewhat from a smooth contact angle pattern that represents the EGC-1700 surface tension. It is argued that noninertness of the molecules of these liquids gives rise to specific interactions with the polymer film, causing the deviations. Furthermore, contact angles of a series of n-alkanes (n-hexane to n-hexadecane) showed systematic deviations from this curve, similar to the trend observed for n-alkanes/Teflon AF 1600 systems studied earlier. Adsorption of vapor of short-chain liquids onto the polymer film caused their contact angles to fall above the gammasv=13.84 mJ/m2 curve, and a parallel alignment of molecules of the long-chain n-alkanes in the vicinity of the solid was the explanation for the deviation of their contact angles below it. It is found that vapor adsorption effect is more significant in the case of Teflon AF 1600, while the alignment of liquid molecules close to the surface is more pronounced for EGC-1700.},

Here we study mica surfaces by dynamic atomic force microscopy (AFM) operated in the non-contact mode (NC-AFM) under ultra-high vacuum (UHV) conditions. Surfaces produced by cleaving in UHV cannot be imaged with NC-AFM due to large surface charges; however, cleavage in air yields much less surface charge and allows for NC-AFM imaging. We present highly resolved NC-AFM images of air-cleaved mica surfaces revealing a rough morphology originating from a high density of nanometre-sized particles. Among these particles, we find regularly shaped structures indicating the growth of crystallites on the surface. The contamination layer cannot be removed by degassing in UHV; even prolonged heating at a temperature of 560 K under UHV conditions does not yield an atomically flat surface.},

abstract = {Perovskite solar cells have rapidly risen to the forefront of emerging photovoltaic technologies, exhibiting rapidly rising efficiencies. This is likely to continue to rise, but in the development of these solar cells there are unusual characteristics that have arisen, specifically an anomalous hysteresis in the current–voltage curves. We identify this phenomenon and show some examples of factors that make the hysteresis more or less extreme. We also demonstrate stabilized power output under working conditions and suggest that this is a useful parameter to present, alongside the current-voltage scan derived power conversion efficiency. We hypothesize three possible origins of the effect and discuss its implications on device efficiency and future research directions. Understanding and resolving the hysteresis is essential for further progress and is likely to lead to a further step improvement in performance.},

@article{Eom2011,
abstract = {Recent advances in nanotechnology have led to the development of nano-electro-mechanical systems (NEMS) such as nanomechanical resonators, which have recently received significant attention from the scientific community. This is not only due to their capability of label-free detection of bio/chemical molecules at single-molecule (or atomic) resolution for future applications such as the early diagnosis of diseases like cancer, but also due to their unprecedented ability to detect physical quantities such as molecular weight, elastic stiffness, surface stress, and surface elastic stiffness for adsorbed molecules on the surface. Most experimental works on resonator-based molecular detection have been based on the principle that molecular adsorption onto a resonator surface increases the effective mass, and consequently decreases the resonant frequencies of the nanomechanical resonator. However, this principle is insufficient to provide fundamental insights into resonator-based molecular detection at the nanoscale; this is due to recently proposed novel nanoscale detection principles including various effects such as surface effects, nonlinear oscillations, coupled resonance, and stiffness effects. Furthermore, these effects have only recently been incorporated into existing physical models for resonators, and therefore the universal physical principles governing nanoresonator-based detection have not been completely described. Therefore, our objective in this review is to overview the current attempts to understand the underlying mechanisms in nanoresonator-based detection using physical models coupled to computational simulations and/or experiments. Specifically, we will focus on issues of special relevance to the dynamic behavior of nanoresonators and their applications in biological/chemical detection: the resonance behavior of micro/nanoresonators; resonator-based chemical/biological detection; physical models of various nanoresonators such as nanowires, carbon nanotubes, and graphene. We pay particular attention to experimental and computational approaches that have been useful in elucidating the mechanisms underlying the dynamic behavior of resonators across multiple and disparate spatial/length scales, and the resulting insight into resonator-based detection that has been obtained. We additionally provide extensive discussion regarding potentially fruitful future research directions coupling experiments and simulations in order to develop a fundamental understanding of the basic physical principles that govern NEMS and NEMS-based sensing and detection applications. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Hybrid AMX3 perovskites (A = Cs, CH3NH3; M = Sn, Pb; X = halide) have revolutionized the scenario of emerging photovoltaic technologies, with very recent results demonstrating 15{\%} efficient solar cells. The CH3NH3PbI3/MAPb(I(1-x)Cl(x))3 perovskites have dominated the field, while the similar CH3NH3SnI3 has not been exploited for photovoltaic applications. Replacement of Pb by Sn would facilitate the large uptake of perovskite-based photovoltaics. Despite the extremely fast progress, the materials electronic properties which are key to the photovoltaic performance are relatively little understood. Density Functional Theory electronic structure methods have so far delivered an unbalanced description of Pb- and Sn-based perovskites. Here we develop an effective GW method incorporating spin-orbit coupling which allows us to accurately model the electronic, optical and transport properties of CH3NH3SnI3 and CH3NH3PbI3, opening the way to new materials design. The different CH3NH3SnI3 and CH3NH3PbI3 electronic properties are discussed in light of their exploitation for solar cells, and found to be dominantly due to relativistic effects. These effects stabilize the CH3NH3PbI3 material towards oxidation, by inducing a deeper valence band edge. Relativistic effects, however, also increase the material band-gap compared to CH3NH3SnI3, due to the valence band energy downshift ({\~{}}0.7 eV) being only partly compensated by the conduction band downshift ({\~{}}0.2 eV).},

abstract = {The relationship between wettability and roughness has been studied on micro-roughened titanium surface after different cleaning procedures. Whereas most studies addressing (super)-hydrophobic behaviors have so far dealt with the wetting of low surface energy and textured substrates in air environment, we here report on a totally novel system and configuration involving the wetting of highly hydrophilic, textured metallic materials in liquid alkane medium, the so-called two liquid phase method. Roughness characterization showed that substrates were isotropic (2D), at a lengthscale much smaller than the size of the drop, with a heterogeneous (vertical) distribution of peaks and valleys. Depending on whether the alkane that initially penetrates and resides in the pores is displaced or not by the water drop (as for air pockets in air environment), we show that different wetting regimes may appear, depending on the cleaning procedure. To our knowledge, this is the first systematic study dealing with the interplay between surface roughness, the wetting behavior and in particular the (super)-hydrophilicity of high surface energy substrates, in non water miscible liquid environments. Whenever competitive processes of liquid/liquid displacement are involved at such high surface energy and textured substrates, such as titanium implant in bone tissue, these results may contribute understanding and predicting their wetting behavior. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Surface properties of wood and stones are very important in influencing the bonding and finishing of wood and for road construction. Two important surface properties are wettability and surface free energy. Contact angle measurement is a simple, useful and sensitive tool for quantifying the wettability and the surface energy of different materials in contact with pure water and/or aqueous surfactant solutions. Nevertheless, a sessile drop on a real surface shows different contact angle values due to its lack of symmetry or to the loss of volume by capillary action. For this reason alternative techniques which supply an average contact angle value are required. In view of this fact, we applied axisymmetric drop shape analysis-diameter (ADSA-D) using a top view of a sessile drop and axisymmetric drop shape analysis-profile (ADSA-P) with a side view of a captive bubble. Both techniques calculate the contact angle by solving the Young–Laplace equation although with different algorithms, the former needs the maximum drop diameter while the last makes use of the complete bubble profile. ADSA-D was applied to study two wood species (eucalyptus and pine) and ADSA-P with polished rocks of two different compositions (silicate and calcite). The maximum contour of the drop was fitted to an ellipse after being detected and extracted by means of a semi-automatic procedure of image processing. Thus, two different contact angles were found out. The captive bubble method in conjunction with the current ADSA-P technique allows to obtain comfortable, automatic and reproducible measurements of contact angle on porous stones.},

abstract = {The goal of Interface Science and Composites is to facilitate the manufacture of technological materials with optimized properties on the basis of a comprehensive understanding of the molecular structure of interfaces and their resulting influence on composite materials processes. From the early development of composites of various natures, the optimization of the interface has been of major importance. While there are many reference books available on composites, few deal specifically with the science and mechanics of the interface of materials and composites. Further, many recent advances in composite interfaces are scattered across the literature and are here assembled in a readily accessible form, bringing together recent developments in the field, both from the materials science and mechanics perspective, in a single convenient volume. The central theme of the book is tailoring the interface science of composites to optimize the basic physical principles rather than on the use of materials and the mechanical performance and structural integrity of composites with enhanced strength/stiffness and fracture toughness (or specific fracture resistance). It also deals mainly with interfaces in advanced composites made from high-performance fibers, such as glass, carbon, aramid, and some inorganic fibers, and matrix materials encompassing polymers, carbon, metals/alloys, and ceramics.   Includes chapter on the development of a nanolevel dispersion of graphene particles in a polymer matrix  Focus on tailoring the interface science of composites to optimize the basic physical principles Covers mainly interfaces in advanced composites made from high performance fibers},

More interestingly, not like the GDC electrolyte, which has some extent of electronic conduction under reducing atmosphere, the composite electrolyte is almost a pure ionic conductor, evidenced by the fuel cell's (FC) open circuit voltage (OCV) close to the theoretical one. The fuel cells based on this composite electrolyte show excellent power density output even at temperature as low as 500 °C (240 mW cm−2 ) in spite of the relatively thick electrolyte (0.4 mm). Such high performance, in combination with its low cost in both raw materials and fabrication process, make this kind of composite electrolyte a good candidate electrolyte material for future ultra-low-cost intermediate temperature ceramic membrane fuel cells (IT-CMFCs).},

Time- and temperature-dependent processes are important in many-body and biological systems, and in systems in the steady-state, but require a continuous input of energy. They involve either time-dependent or energy-dissipating effects, or both, and are difficult to understand at the molecular level. The chapter presents an overview of the time- and rate-dependent interactions and processes. Relationship between time, temperature, and velocity in complex processes is explained in detail. Concepts of rate- and time-dependent detachment forces, energy transfer during molecular collisions, and energy transfer during cyclic bonding–unbonding processes are also explained. The chapter presents an example to illustrate why different results are obtained when measurements of adhesion or unbinding forces are made at different rates or over different times even though the potential energy function is the same.},

abstract = {This chapter introduces biological interactions or biointeractions as ongoing energy-consuming “processes” that evolve in space and time, and have no beginning or end. A biological interaction is different from a simple chemical reaction or physical change of a system. This is due in part to the higher complexity of biological macromolecules and systems that typically exhibit a hierarchy of nonequilibrium structures ranging in size from proteins to membranes and cells, to tissues and organs, and finally to whole organisms. Biological interactions do not occur in a linear, stepwise fashion, but involve competing interactions, branching pathways, feedback loops, and regulatory mechanisms. Biological interactions are essentially “dynamic” since biological systems are never at thermodynamic equilibrium, and they are not closed systems. This chapter begins with explaining the subtleties of biological forces and interactions. It then discusses the general considerations for interactions that evolve in space and time. The Bell and Jarzynski equations related to biological rupture and capture are discussed. The chapter elaborates the concept of multiple bonds in series and in parallel. The chapter concludes with a comparison study of self-assembly versus directed assembly.},

abstract = {The current general problems of formulation and determination of surface free energy are discussed. So far several theories and approaches have been proposed, but formulation of surface and interfacial free energy, as regards its components, is still a very debatable issue. However, as long as no method for determination of real surface free energy quantities is known, even relative values charged with many simplified assumptions are useful for better understanding of the wetting processes. In this paper special focus is concentrated on powdered solids for which direct measurement of the contact angles is not possible. For such solids the porous layer imbibition techniques are most frequently applied. Then, using the wicking results the contact angle is calculated from Washburn's equation. However, such a procedure leads to overestimated contact angle values in comparison to those measured directly on smooth surfaces of the same solid, if such surface can be obtained at all. As a consequence, the solid surface free energy components calculated via such overestimated contact angles are significantly lower than those obtained from contact angles measured directly. Methodologies to avoid this problem are also described.},

By exposing the liquid-metal surface at room temperature to doses on the order of 180 L of oxygen where 1 L=10-6 Torr s, a gallium oxide film with a well-defined thickness of ∼5 Å readily forms. The oxide thickness and roughness of the liquid/oxide and oxide/vapor interfaces do not change with oxygen dosage up to 1600 L nor with temperature up to 573 K. This is in contrast to what is observed for the bare liquid-Ga surface, which is roughened significantly by thermally excited capillary waves with temperatures up to only 443 K. This is a good indication that the oxide layer provides rigidity to the liquid surface and is likely a solid; grazing-incidence measurements suggest that the film is amorphous or poorly crystallized. Based on comparisons with known crystal structures, models are suggested for the atomic arrangements in the gallium oxide layer and its interface with the underlying liquid.},

The chapter explains how these interaction forces naturally lead to molecular packing considerations in determining natural formation of the structures. The chapter discusses the properties of amphiphilic structures. These structures can be hard and solid-like, but they are more often soft or fluid-like, with molecules in constant thermal motion within each aggregate. These thermal motions include twisting, turning, diffusing, and bobbing in and out of the surface. Unlike colloidal particles, soft amphiphilic structures have no definite size or shape, but only a distribution about some mean value. The chapter starts by introducing equilibrium considerations of fluid amphiphilic structures. It explains the concepts of optimal headgroup area, spherical micelles, bilayers, vesicles, biological membranes, and membrane lipids. The chapter explains the concept of “equilibrium structures” with reference to the Gibbs phase rule. The chapter also presents a discussion on curvature energies and elasticities of monolayers and bilayers.

abstract = {In this study, the surface characteristics of three major materials which are widely used in food industry, glass, polyethylene (PE) and stainless steel (SS 316), were studied. The hydrophilicity, hydrophobicity and surface free energy (SFE) of those surfaces were determined by contact angle measurements prior and after plasma polymerisation treatment. The modification of the surfaces was carried out at low pressure and low temperature plasma conditions by using different monomers with functional properties. Phenol and 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexaflouroisopropylacrylate (HFIPA) were used to produce hydrophobic materials with low surface energy, and hydroxyethylmethacrylate (HEMA), ethylenediamine (EDA), polyethyleneglycolethylethermethacrylate (PEGEEMA) and polyethyleneglycolmethacrylate (PEGMA) were used to produce hydrophilic materials with higher surface energy. The effects of monomer flow rate, exposure time and discharge power parameters were optimized by comparing surface characteristics before and after plasma polymerisation treatments. Contact angle measurements were performed by using the captive bubble technique, and the geometric mean equation was used to calculate the surface free energy values. Air and n-octane bubbles with different polarity were used to determine the changes on the surface energy including the dispersive and polar components. Polyethylene was the most hydrophobic material among the materials used in this study related to its air contact angle and $\gamma$sw values. $\gamma$sw value was found 38.91 mJ/m2 for polyethylene. Glass was determined as the most hydrophilic material ($\gamma$sw: 1.11 mJ/m2) among the used surfaces, and its surface energy ($\gamma$sv) was 58.95 mJ/m2. The contact angle and SFE values were affected by monomer flow rate, exposure time and power parameters used for all modification processes. The equilibrium between etching and deposition processes can be controlled by these plasma parameters. Therefore, we tried to optimize plasma parameters according to the results from contact angle and surface energy data. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

@article{Kumar2007,
abstract = {Wettability is a tendency for a liquid to spread on a solid substrate and is generally measured in terms of the angle (contact angle) between the tangent drawn at the triple point between the three phases (solid, liquid and vapour) and the substrate surface. A liquid spreading on a substrate with no reaction/absorption of the liquid by substrate material is known as non-reactive or inert wetting whereas the wetting process influenced by reaction between the spreading liquid and substrate material is known as reactive wetting. Young's equation gives the equilibrium contact angle in terms of interfacial tensions existing at the three-phase interface. The derivation of Young's equation is made under the assumptions of spreading of non-reactive liquid on an ideal (physically and chemically inert, smooth, homogeneous and rigid) solid, a condition that is rarely met in practical situations. Nevertheless Young's equation is the most fundamental starting point for understanding of the complex field of wetting. Reliable and reproducible measurements of contact angle from the experiments are important in order to analyze the wetting behaviour. Various methods have been developed over the years to evaluate wettability of a solid by a liquid. Among these, sessile drop and wetting balance techniques are versatile, popular and provide reliable data. Wetting is affected by large number of factors including liquid properties, substrate properties and system conditions. The effect of these factors on wettability is discussed. Thermodynamic treatment of wetting in inert systems is simple and based on free energy minimization where as that in reactive systems is quite complex. Surface energetics has to be considered while determining the driving force for spreading. Similar is the case of spreading kinetics. Inert systems follow definite flow pattern and in most cases a single function is sufficient to describe the whole kinetics. Theoretical models successfully describe the spreading in inert systems. However, it is difficult to determine the exact mechanism that controls the kinetics since reactive wetting is affected by a number of factors like interfacial reactions, diffusion of constituents, dissolution of the substrate, etc. The quantification of the effect of these interrelated factors on wettability would be useful to build a predictive model of wetting kinetics for reactive systems.},

More recently, and particularly in the past decade, the pace of research has been rapid, driven by the requirements for new clean energy sources, sensors, and high energy density batteries. A very interesting subgroup of this class of materials are the oxides that display oxygen ion conductivity. As well as the intrinsic interest in these materials, there has been a continued drive for their development because of the promise of important technological devices such as the solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC), oxygen separation membranes, and membranes for the conversion of methane to syngas1. All of these devices offer the potential of enormous commercial and ecological benefits provided suitable high performance materials can be developed. In this article we will review the materials currently under development for application in such devices with particular reference to some of the newly discovered oxide ion conductors.},

abstract = {This chapter presents a study on polymer-mediated steric forces and thermal fluctuation forces. The steric forces between surfaces with end grafted chains are well understood both theoretically and experimentally, and are well defined. Thermal fluctuation forces are essentially entropic or osmotic in origin and are also referred to as entropically driven or protrusion forces. This chapter explains the purely repulsive steric force between two polymer-covered surfaces interacting in a liquid. It also details the concepts of polymer-associated interactions that are attractive or that modify steric interactions. The chapter begins with a discussion on diffuse interfaces in liquids. The states of polymers in solution and at surfaces are then explained. The chapter introduces the concepts of repulsive “steric” or “overlap” forces between polymer-covered surfaces. The chapter also discusses attractive “intersegment” and “bridging” forces and attractive “depletion” forces. Nonequilibrium aspects of polymer interactions are also discussed. The chapter concludes with a discussion on thermal fluctuations and forces between fluid-like interfaces.},

abstract = {Iron-Gallium alloy (Galfenol) is a magnetostrictive material ( (lambda {\_}{\{}mathrm {\{}sat{\}}{\}}sim 400) ppm) with potential for robust transduction. In addition, Galfenol is auxetic in the {\textless}110{\textgreater} direction with Poisson's ratio values of as low as −0.7. In recent years, this phenomenon has been examined with several experimental protocols. The negative Poisson's ratio of Fe–Ga (attributed to lattice softening under applied stresses) has been documented using tensile tests (with and without a dc magnetic bias) and resonant ultrasound spectroscopy. In addition, density functional theory has been used to produce simulations that explain atomic mechanisms for the observed highly auxetic behavior in this alloy. This paper examines the auxetic response of Galfenol to varying magnetic fields and zero applied stress. An energy based mathematical model of the coupled magnetoelastic properties of the alloy is derived and used to predict Poisson's ratio at magnetic saturation. The results from this approach with no mechanical excitation shows an increase in the Poisson's ratio with increase in the Ga content of the alloy. This is opposite to the trends observed with applied stresses where there is a decrease in the Poisson's ratio with increase in the Ga content. Experimental results for Galfenol of compositions between 15 and 33 atomic percent Gallium will be presented and compared with values from the magnetoelastic model.},

abstract = {In this study, we investigate magnetic fieldannealing of Fe 82.5 Ga 17.5 single crystal disks with two easy axes ([100] and [010]) in the plane of the disk. Magnetic annealing was conducted with a high magnetic field ( H {\textgreater} 12 kOe ) applied along the [100] or [010] easy axes of the demagnetized, as-grown, slow-cooled sample. Strain measurements were recorded both before and after the magnetic annealing of the samples from a demagnetized state. After each annealing protocol, the resultant built-in uniaxial anisotropy constants were measured using torque magnetometry and also using an approach that calculates anisotropy based on magnetization curves. The built-in anisotropy constant after magnetic annealing strongly depends on annealing protocol. The calculated anisotropy constants determined for each sample show consistent trends for each annealing condition using the two different anisotropymeasurement methods. The maximum uniaxial anisotropy constant was 4.24 kJ ∕ m 3 and the built-in effective prestress was − 19.9 MPa after field annealing.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to better understand the effect of non-rubber substances (mainly proteins and lipids) on adhesion (against glasses) and self-adhesion tack properties of uncrosslinked natural rubber (NR). Various types of NR, with or without non-rubber constituents, were prepared. Synthetic polyisoprene rubber was also used as a reference material. All the rubbers were first characterized by many techniques (FT-IR, DSC, GPC, etc.). Two experimental tests were specially utilized to measure the level of adhesion and self-adhesion: (i) at very short contact times (from a few milliseconds up to 0.1 s) the impact of a pendulum and (ii) for longer contact times (from 0.1 s to a few h) the contact of a probe using a tensile testing machine. The tack energy increased with contact time for all the rubbers studied. Natural rubber which did not contain proteins and lipids exhibited the highest adhesion and self-adhesion tack abilities. In contrast, whole natural rubber, containing both proteins and lipids, showed the lowest tack property. In each case, self-adhesion levels are higher than those of adhesion, presumably due to interdiffusion of macromolecular chains or chain segments at the interface.},

We report a low-cost, solution-processable solar cell, based on a highly crystalline perovskite absorber with intense visible to near-infrared absorptivity, that has a power conversion efficiency of 10.9{\%} in a single-junction device under simulated full sunlight. This "meso-superstructured solar cell" exhibits exceptionally few fundamental energy losses; it can generate open-circuit photovoltages of more than 1.1 volts, despite the relatively narrow absorber band gap of 1.55 electron volts. The functionality arises from the use of mesoporous alumina as an inert scaffold that structures the absorber and forces electrons to reside in and be transported through the perovskite.},

@article{Hoorfar2006,
abstract = {Axisymmetric Drop Shape Analysis (ADSA) is a powerful technique for the measurement of interfacial properties from the shape of drops/bubbles. It relies on the best fit between theoretical curves with known surface tension values and an experimental profile. Despite the general success of ADSA, inconsistent results are obtained for nearly spherical drop shapes. Since the source of this and possible other limitations are unknown, the entire ADSA technique including hardware and software is systematically scrutinized. The hardware consists of electronics, and optical and mechanical components that generate a digital image of a drop. Since the quality of images has a considerable impact on the surface tension measurements, general guidelines for the use of hardware components are developed to enhance the quality of the image. The scrutiny of the software of ADSA is significantly more involved. The software consists of image analysis and numerical schemes. One of the key elements is the modularization of the software, since a generic software package is not suitable for all experimental situations. As a result, a more versatile image analysis module is introduced. In this context a variety of state-of-the-art edge detection techniques are studied, and a more robust technique is adopted. The two existing ADSA numerical schemes are also compared systematically, and the more efficient one is implemented. It is shown that even this superior numerical scheme has convergence problems for nearly spherical drops. This difficulty is due to numerical truncation and accumulation of round-off errors, which are the ultimate limitation of all numerical schemes. This intrinsic limitation becomes more pronounced as drops become closer to spherical in shape, but there were no objective criteria available to define "close to spherical drops". Therefore, a quantitative criterion called shape parameter is introduced to identify the range of applicability of ADSA. The improved version of ADSA not only determines the interfacial properties more accurately but, through the shape parameter, also provides an a priori knowledge of the accuracy of the results.},

abstract = {Galfenol (FexGa100−x), a magnetostrictive alloy (3/2$\lambda$ 110–400 ppm) of Iron and Gallium exhibits an in-plane auxetic response in the ⟨110⟩ crystallographic direction. Negative Poisson{\&}apos;s ratios have been observed in response to application of stress fields, where values of as low as −0.7 have been reported for compositions of greater than roughly 20{\%} Ga [Zhang et al., J. Appl. Phys. 108(2), 023513 (2010)] and in response to application of magnetic fields, where values of as low as −2.5 have been reported to be expected for compositions of less than roughly 20{\%} Ga [G. Raghunath and A. B. Flatau, IEEE Trans. Magn. (in press)]. Several models have been proposed to understand these two distinct phenomena. Galfenol samples with less than 20{\%} Ga also exhibit an unusual response to an increasing magnetic field applied along the ⟨110⟩ direction. The longitudinal strain which increases initially with applied field experiences a dip (until ∼10 mT) before increasing again to reach saturation. The transverse strain increases and reaches a maximum value (at the same field of ∼10 mT) and then drops from the maximum by 5{\%}–10{\%} as magnetic saturation is approached [G. Raghunath and A. B. Flatau, IEEE Trans. Magn. (in press)].This work deals with discussing the evolution of magnetic domains in a 16 at. {\%} Ga single crystal Galfenol sample when subjected to magnetic fields in the ⟨110⟩ direction in the (100) plane. The magnetic domains on the surface of mechanically polished Galfenol samples were imaged using Magneto-Optic Kerr Effect microscopy. Simultaneously, the strains along the longitudinal and transverse ⟨110⟩ directions were recorded using a bi-directional strain gauge rosette mounted on the unpolished bottom surface of the planar samples. The energy from the applied magnetic field is expected to grow the ⟨110⟩ oriented domains at the expense of domains oriented along all other directions. But since the plane has an easy ⟨100⟩ axis, we expect the domains to orient along the easy direction before saturating along the applied magnetic field direction. A correlation between the images recorded and the strains observed will be used to understand this shift of domains and bump in strain at low fields.},

abstract = {Interfacial science impacts on our lives in diverse and surprising ways. Without it, we would face bubble bath without the bubbles, detergents which don't clean, cappuccinos without the froth. It has also fuelled some of the most ground-breaking and thought-provoking advances in research in recent times, from biosciences to nanotechnology. Introduction to Interfacial Science offers an engaging insight into the study of the physical and chemical properties of interfaces, how they behave, why they behave as they do, and how this behaviour can be harnessed and exploited in novel and exciting ways. Interfacial Science: An Introduction is an accessible text introducing readers to the chemistry of interfaces, a subject of increasing relevance and popularity due to the emergence of nanoscience. Opening with an overview of the key principles of capilliarity and adsorption, the book goes on to explore liquid/gas, solid/gas, and liquid/liquid interfaces, before examining biological interfaces, one of the most stimulating areas of current research. With the careful explanation of essential mathematical and physical concepts, and description of real world applications of the material presented, the book helps the student to build confidence in, and see the relevance of, the topics covered. Striking a careful balance between the highly mathematical treatments of the subject by more specialist texts, and the rudimentary treatment offered by general physical chemistry texts, Interfacial Science: An Introduction offers a breadth and depth of treatment which is perfect for any advanced undergraduate course on this exciting, dynamic subject. Online Resource Centre The Online Resource Centre to accompany Interfacial Science: An Introduction features the following resources for registered adopters of the text: - Downloadable figures - Solutions manual, containing worked solutions to the exercises appearing in the textbook - Protocols for around five laboratory experiments, appearing as MS Word documents, for lecturers to modify to suit their own particular setups},

@article{Stoumpos2013,
abstract = {A broad organic-inorganic series of hybrid metal iodide perovskites with the general formulation AMI3, where A is the methylammonium (CH3NH3(+)) or formamidinium (HC(NH2)2(+)) cation and M is Sn (1 and 2) or Pb (3 and 4) are reported. The compounds have been prepared through a variety of synthetic approaches, and the nature of the resulting materials is discussed in terms of their thermal stability and optical and electronic properties. We find that the chemical and physical properties of these materials strongly depend on the preparation method. Single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis of 1-4 classifies the compounds in the perovskite structural family. Structural phase transitions were observed and investigated by temperature-dependent single crystal X-ray diffraction in the 100-400 K range. The charge transport properties of the materials are discussed in conjunction with diffuse reflectance studies in the mid-IR region that display characteristic absorption features. Temperature-dependent studies show a strong dependence of the resistivity as a function of the crystal structure. Optical absorption measurements indicate that 1-4 behave as direct-gap semiconductors with energy band gaps distributed in the range of 1.25-1.75 eV. The compounds exhibit an intense near-IR photoluminescence (PL) emission in the 700-1000 nm range (1.1-1.7 eV) at room temperature. We show that solid solutions between the Sn and Pb compounds are readily accessible throughout the composition range. The optical properties such as energy band gap, emission intensity, and wavelength can be readily controlled as we show for the isostructural series of solid solutions CH3NH3Sn(1-x)Pb(x)I3 (5). The charge transport type in these materials was characterized by Seebeck coefficient and Hall-effect measurements. The compounds behave as p- or n-type semiconductors depending on the preparation method. The samples with the lowest carrier concentration are prepared from solution and are n-type; p-type samples can be obtained through solid state reactions exposed in air in a controllable manner. In the case of Sn compounds, there is a facile tendency toward oxidation which causes the materials to be doped with Sn(4+) and thus behave as p-type semiconductors displaying metal-like conductivity. The compounds appear to possess very high estimated electron and hole mobilities that exceed 2000 cm(2)/(V s) and 300 cm(2)/(V s), respectively, as shown in the case of CH3NH3SnI3 (1). We also compare the properties of the title hybrid materials with those of the "all-inorganic" CsSnI3 and CsPbI3 prepared using identical synthetic methods.},

abstract = {This chapter presents a discussion on friction and lubrication forces. Friction and lubrication forces act in different ways. They have no force law and arise only as a reaction to motion or another force. They are referred to as nonconservation forces because they involve energy loss or dissipation or transfer of energy from one body or form to another. There are four friction mechanisms that include load-controlled friction, adhesion-controlled friction, elastohydrodynamic friction, and rolling friction. Friction forces are generally not symmetrical on exchanging the stationary and moving surfaces. The chapter begins with an overview of the origin of friction and lubrication forces. Relationships between adhesion and friction forces are then explained. The chapter presents a discussion on Amonton's laws of friction. Concepts of smooth and stick-slip sliding as well as lubricated sliding are then explained. Detailed study of transitions between liquid- and solid-like films is then presented. The chapter concludes with introducing a theoretical model for friction mechanisms.},

Any measurement of a physical or chemical property is in some respect a measurement of intermolecular forces. Methods, such as osmotic pressure measurements, involve the collective interactions of many molecules or particles so that the data gained tend to be of a statistical or thermodynamic nature and not directly translatable into a force-law. This chapter discusses the typical range and strengths of the interaction energies and adhesion forces associated with differently sized particles, which in turn determines the most suitable experimental techniques for studying them. The chapter explains the mechanics of direct force measurements and problems of interpretation. It then details the concepts of mechanical instabilities, energetic instabilities, and thermodynamic instabilities. Techniques of measuring forces between macroscopic surfaces, such as surface force apparatuses, osmotic pressure/osmotic stress, and related techniques are explained. Techniques for measuring forces between microscopic (colloidal) and nanoscopic particles were also explained using atomic force microscopy and total internal reflection microscopy.},

abstract = {This chapter explores the interactions that involve polar molecules. Dipolar or polar molecules are the molecules that posses an electric dipole. The dipoles of some molecules depend on their environment and can change substantially when they are transferred from one medium to another, especially when molecules become ionized in a solvent. When two polar molecules are near each other, there is a dipole–dipole interaction between them that is analogous to that between two magnets. Polarity can also arise from internal charge displacements within a molecule, producing zwitterionic molecules or groups. In larger molecules, or “macromolecules,” such as proteins, the net dipole moment is usually made up of a distribution of positive and negative charges at various locations of the molecules. The chapter discusses electrostatic pair interaction between a charged atom and a polar molecule. The chapter explains strong ion–dipole interactions in water. The solvation forces, structural forces, and hydration forces are also explained. The chapter concludes with a discussion on dipole–dipole interactions.},

abstract = {The effects of substitutional and interstitial additions on uniaxial anisotropy ( K uni ) generated via stress annealing were investigated for the galfenol (Fe–Ga) alloy system. Polycrystalline samples prepared via free stand zone melt directional solidification technique were tested under pre- and post-stress annealed conditions in order to ascertain the extent of the built-in stress ( T built-in ) created. Energy based modeling utilizing magnetostriction and magnetization data was used to determine K uni and T built-in . Differential magnetomechanical properties; d 33 and $\mu$ r were estimated using the same model. Carbon additions from a Fe–C master alloy resulted in K uni and T built-in values of 12.1   kJ / m 3 and 55 MPa, comparable to the binary system. Low carbon steel additions resulted in a minor decrease in K uni to 9.6   kJ / m 3 , but still had high T built-in values of 54 MPa. Aluminum additions exhibited the largest decreases in K uni and T built-in . A linear decrease in both values was observed as a function of increasing aluminum content. K uni values for Fe 81.6 Ga 13.8 Al 4.6 and Fe 81.6 Ga 9.2 Al 9.2 alloys were 6.7 and 4.2   kJ / m 3 , respectively. T built-in values for Fe 81.6 Ga 13.8 Al 4.6 and Fe 81.6 Ga 9.2 Al 9.2 alloys were 37 and 24 MPa, respectively. Estimated d 33 and $\mu$ r values ranged from 2.0 to 2.7 × 10 − 8   m / A and 120–170 for all compositions studied.},

abstract = {The possibility of manipulating magnetic systems without applied magnetic fields have attracted growing attention over the past fifteen years. The low-power manipulation of the magnetization, preferably at ultrashort timescales, has become a fundamental challenge with implications for future magnetic information memory and storage technologies. Here we explore the optical manipulation of the magnetization in engineered magnetic materials. We demonstrate that all-optical helicity-dependent switching (AO-HDS) can be observed not only in selected rare earth-transition metal (RE-TM) alloy films but also in a much broader variety of materials, including RE-TM alloys, multilayers and heterostructures. We further show that RE-free Co-Ir-based synthetic ferrimagnetic heterostructures designed to mimic the magnetic properties of RE-TM alloys also exhibit AO-HDS. These results challenge present theories of AO-HDS and provide a pathway to engineering materials for future applications based on all-optical control of magnetic order.},

@book{Israelachvili2011e,
abstract = {This chapter presents an overview of van der Waals forces and their role in various molecular phenomena. There are three distinct types of forces that contribute to the total long-range interaction between polar molecules, which are collectively known as the van der Waals force. These three forces include the induction force, the orientation force, and the dispersion force. Each force has an interaction free energy that varies with the inverse sixth power of the distance. Unlike gravitational and Coulomb forces, van der Waals forces are not generally pairwise additive. The force between any two molecules is affected by the presence of other molecules nearby, so simple addition of all the pair potentials of a molecule does not give net interaction energy with all the other molecules. This chapter starts with explaining the contribution of dispersion forces to the total van der Waals force between atoms and molecules. The chapter explores important features of van der Waals forces and discusses the origin of the van der Waals-dispersion force between the neutral molecules. The van der Waals equation of states was also explained.},

abstract = {We have investigated nano-scale magnetic structures to learn how magnetic behaviors differ from what is observed in bulk materials. In this study, we have measured the magnetic hysteresis of individual multilayered nanowire using a magnetic force microscopy (MFM). The nanowires were composed of low-aspect ratio segments of iron-gallium (Galfenol, Fe80Ga20) and copper layers. Individual wires were released from nano-porous anodized aluminum oxide (AAO) templates and separated from other nanowires to avoid significant interactions between nearby nanowires. In this experiment, structures with aspects ratios c/a of ∼3 were studied. Different MFM phase magnitudes in response to the interaction of magnetic film coated MFM tips and Fe-Ga/Cu nanowire were observed as a function of applied external magnetic field (−850 Oe {\textless} H {\textless} 850 Oe). Amplitude differences between bright and dark responses in MFM images were used to demonstrate hysteresis. Coercivity measured was about 125 Oe, which is almost same as the coercivity value (∼150 Oe) of a nanowire array measured with a vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM). When fields are applied perpendicular to the nanowires, the hysteresis loops sheared, indicating that the easy axis is along the nanowire axis. Remanence magnetizations of an individual nanowire and a nanowire array were compared to demonstrate inter-wire magnetostatic dipolar interaction.},

abstract = {The intermetallic compound NiAl exhibits a relatively wide homogenity range around the stoichiometric composition in the Ni-Al phase diagram. The properties of this material make it suitable for many engineering applications, such as high temperature environmental coatings, surface catalysts, electronic metallizations in semiconductor heterostructures and turbine blades. Among its excellent engineering properties are high melting temperature, high oxidation resistance, high modulus of elasticity, low density, and metal-like thermal and electrical conductivity. However, the main obstacle, which still prevents the NiAl compound from being largely applied is its low-temperature brittleness and poor high-temperature creep resistance. It was found that the NiAl brittleness could be related with the intergranular brittle fracture along the grain boundaries (GBs). Intergranular brittleness correlates with the GB free energy, so that lowering the GB energy should result in a decrease of the intergranular brittleness. Since all attempts to improve NiAl ductility by alloying with third component were inconclusive, it was suggested to employ the Grain boundary engineering (GBE) concept for solving this problem. In order apply this technique, a knowledge of the factors that determine GB properties (especially GB energy) is needed.},

abstract = {The performance of organometallic perovskite solar cells has rapidly surpassed that of both conventional dye-sensitized and organic photovoltaics. High-power conversion efficiency can be realized in both mesoporous and thin-film device architectures. We address the origin of this success in the context of the materials chemistry and physics of the bulk perovskite as described by electronic structure calculations. In addition to the basic optoelectronic properties essential for an efficient photovoltaic device (spectrally suitable band gap, high optical absorption, low carrier effective masses), the materials are structurally and compositionally flexible. As we show, hybrid perovskites exhibit spontaneous electric polarization; we also suggest ways in which this can be tuned through judicious choice of the organic cation. The presence of ferroelectric domains will result in internal junctions that may aid separation of photoexcited electron and hole pairs, and reduction of recombination through segregation of charge carriers. The combination of high dielectric constant and low effective mass promotes both Wannier-Mott exciton separation and effective ionization of donor and acceptor defects. The photoferroic effect could be exploited in nanostructured films to generate a higher open circuit voltage and may contribute to the current-voltage hysteresis observed in perovskite solar cells.},

@article{Stalder2006,
abstract = {We present a new method based on B-spline snakes (active contours) for measuring high-accuracy contact angles. In this approach, we avoid making physical assumptions by defining the contour of the drop as a versatile B-spline curve. When useful, we extend this curve by mirror symmetry so that we can take advantage of the reflection of the drop onto the substrate to detect the position of the contact points. To keep a wide range of applicability, we refrain from discretizing the contour of the drop, and we choose to optimize an advanced image-energy term to drive the evolution of the curve. This term has directional gradient and region-based components; additionally, another term—an internal energy—is responsible for the snake elasticity and constrains the parameterization of the spline. While preserving precision at the contact points, we limit the computational complexity by constraining a non-uniform repartition of the control points. The elasticity property of the snake links the local nature of the contact angle to the global contour of the drop. A global knowledge of the drop contour allows us to use the reflection of the drop on the substrate to automatically and precisely detect a line of contact points (vertical position and tilt). We apply cubic-spline interpolation over the image of the drop; then, the evolution procedure takes part in this continuous domain to avoid the inaccuracies introduced by pixelization and discretization. We have programmed our method as a Java software and we make it freely available [A.F. Stalder, DropSnake, Biomedical Imaging Group, EPFL, [ON LINE] visited 2005. http://bigwww.epfl.ch/demo/dropanalysis]. Our experiments result in good accuracy thanks to our high-quality image-interpolation model, while they show applicability to a variety of images thanks to our advanced image-energy term.},

abstract = {Fe-Ga alloys, in which the $\alpha$-Fe structure is maintained, are rich sources of high strength, low cost magnetostrictive alloys for transducer and vibration reduction applications. Although the magnetostriction of Fe itself is very low, when a relatively small fraction of the Fe atoms are replaced by Ga, the magnetostriction, (3/2)$\lambda$100, increases greatly. Until recently, the highest magnetostriction was found with the replacement of Fe by Al (Alfenol). In this paper, we present our measurements of magnetostriction on Fe1-xGax, 0.13≤ x≤ 0.24, (Galfenol). With the substitution of 19{\%} Ga for Fe in Fe1-xGax, a 12-fold increase in magnetostriction to ∼ 400 ppm occurs, even though Ga is non-magnetic. In these alloys, the saturation magnetizations remain high, Ms≅ 1.7 T, and the Curie temperatures are far above room temperature, TC≅ 700°C. In most alloys studied, the magnetostrictions and magnetizations are fully saturated in fields less than 24 kA/m, even under compressive stresses {\textgreater}100 MPa. For x=0.24 (near Fe3Ga), an anomalous increase in magnetostriction with temperature occurs with a peak magnetostriction above room temperature. Small additions of Ni and Mo to the binary Fe-Ga alloys decrease the room temperature value of $\lambda$100.},

In the current paper, the contact angle of graphene synthesized by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) was monitored temporally after synthesis using water, diiodomethane, ethylene glycol, and glycerol. The surface energy was then calculated based on the contact angle data by Fowkes, Owens-Wendt (extended Fowkes), and Neumann models. The surface energy of fresh CVD graphene grown on a copper substrate (G/Cu) immediately after synthesis was determined to be 62.2 mJ/m2 (Fowkes), 53.0 mJ/m2 (Owens-Wendt) and 63.8 mJ/m2 (Neumann), which decreased to 45.6 mJ/m2, 37.5 mJ/m2 and 57.4 mJ/m2, respectively, after 24 hours of air exposure. The ellipsometry characterization indicates that the surface energy of G/Cu is affected by airborne hydrocarbon contamination. G/Cu exhibits the highest surface energy immediately after synthesis and the surface energy decreases after airborne contamination occurs. The root-cause of intrinsically mild polarity of G/Cu surface is discussed.},

abstract = {Titanium dioxide is the most investigated single-crystalline system in the surface science of metal oxides, and the literature on rutile (110), (100), (001), and anatase surfaces is reviewed. This paper starts with a summary of the wide variety of technical fields where TiO2 is of importance. The bulk structure and bulk defects (as far as relevant to the surface properties) are briefly reviewed. Rules to predict stable oxide surfaces are exemplified on rutile (110). The surface structure of rutile (110) is discussed in some detail. Theoretically predicted and experimentally determined relaxations of surface geometries are compared, and defects (step edge orientations, point and line defects, impurities, surface manifestations of crystallographic shear planes—CSPs) are discussed, as well as the image contrast in scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). The controversy about the correct model for the (1×2) reconstruction appears to be settled. Different surface preparation methods, such as reoxidation of reduced crystals, can cause a drastic effect on surface geometries and morphology, and recommendations for preparing different TiO2(110) surfaces are given. The structure of the TiO2(100)-(1×1) surface is discussed and the proposed models for the (1×3) reconstruction are critically reviewed. Very recent results on anatase (100) and (101) surfaces are included. The electronic structure of stoichiometric TiO2 surfaces is now well understood. Surface defects can be detected with a variety of surface spectroscopies. The vibrational structure is dominated by strong Fuchs–Kliewer phonons, and high-resolution electron energy loss spectra often need to be deconvoluted in order to render useful information about adsorbed molecules. The growth of metals (Li, Na, K, Cs, Ca, Al, Ti, V, Nb, Cr, Mo, Mn, Fe, Co, Rh, Ir, Ni, Pd, Pt, Cu, Ag, Au) as well as some metal oxides on TiO2 is reviewed. The tendency to ‘wet' the overlayer, the growth morphology, the epitaxial relationship, and the strength of the interfacial oxidation/reduction reaction all follow clear trends across the periodic table, with the reactivity of the overlayer metal towards oxygen being the most decisive factor. Alkali atoms form ordered superstructures at low coverages. Recent progress in understanding the surface structure of metals in the ‘strong-metal support interaction' (SMSI) state is summarized. Literature is reviewed on the adsorption and reaction of a wide variety of inorganic molecules (H2, O2, H2O, CO, CO2, N2, NH3, NOx, sulfur- and halogen-containing molecules, rare gases) as well as organic molecules (carboxylic acids, alcohols, aldehydes and ketones, alkynes, pyridine and its derivates, silanes, methyl halides). The application of TiO2-based systems in photo-active devices is discussed, and the results on UHV-based photocatalytic studies are summarized. The review ends with a brief conclusion and outlook of TiO2-based surface science for the future.},

Recent reports of highly efficient CH3NH3PbI3-based solar cells in a broad range of configurations raise a compelling case for understanding the fundamental photophysical mechanisms in these materials. By applying femtosecond transient optical spectroscopy to bilayers that interface this perovskite with either selective-electron or selective-hole extraction materials, we have uncovered concrete evidence of balanced long-range electron-hole diffusion lengths of at least 100 nanometers in solution-processed CH3NH3PbI3. The high photoconversion efficiencies of these systems stem from the comparable optical absorption length and charge-carrier diffusion lengths, transcending the traditional constraints of solution-processed semiconductors.},

abstract = {The properties of polymer ultrathin films are a subject of intense study from both practical and academic viewpoints. Previously, we found that upon compression, an isotactic poly(methyl methacrylate) (it-PMMA) Langmuir monolayer crystallized to form a two-dimensional (2D) folded-chain crystal, and the molecular image of the crystal with chain folding and tie chains was clearly visualized by atomic force microscopy (AFM). In the present study, the melting behaviors of the it-PMMA 2D crystals were successfully observed in situ by high-temperature AFM at the molecular lever for the first time. The chain-chain distances ({\~{}}1.2 nm) of the crystals were clearly resolved even at temperatures close to the melting temperatures (Tm) of the 2D crystals. We found that the Tm of the 2D crystals was at most 90 °C lower than the bulk crystals. The Tm depression strongly depended on the molecular weight, while the molecular weight dependence of the bulk Tm was negligible in the molecular weight regime studied. The Tm depression also depended on the substrates, a slightly larger depression being observed on a sapphire substrate compared to that on a mica. The large Tm depressions of the 2D crystals could not be explained by a simple Thomson-Gibbs argument, theoretical developments are necessary to understand the melting of the 2D crystals.},

Distributions of Psis are found to shift to lower angles and approach the true Psis value as the resolution of the technique increases, with the MRL technique having the highest resolution, a median angle of 113o+- 1o and a distribution of angles from 90o+- 5o to 139o+- 3o.},

abstract = {This chapter briefly reviews the historical development of the idea of intermolecular forces starting from the ancient Greeks to the present day. The Greeks were first to consider forces in a nonreligious way. The notion of doing experiments to find out how nature works was an unknown concept until Galileo demonstrated its power in his classic experiments on gravity, the motion of bodies, optics, astronomy, and proving the existence of a vacuum. The first half of the nineteenth century saw a continuation of the controversy about whether matter was a continuum or made up of molecules with the balance slowly tilting toward the continuum picture. The latter half of the nineteenth century saw the return of molecules, with successes of the new kinetic theory and the Van der Waals equation of state, both of which were based on attraction of molecules. By the early twentieth century, it was recognized that intermolecular forces are not of a simple nature, and the pursuit of one basic force law gave way to a less ambitious search for semiempirical expressions that could account for specific phenomena. Today, the origin of intermolecular forces is known, and it is established that all intermolecular forces are essentially electrostatic in origin.},

abstract = {Atomic force microscopy (AFM) is capable of solid surface characterization at the microscopic and submicroscopic scales. It can also be used for the determination of surface tension of solids (gamma) from pull-off force (F) measurements, followed by analysis of the measured F values using contact mechanics theoretical models. Although a majority of the literature gamma results was obtained using either Johnson-Kendall-Roberts (JKR) or Derjaguin-Muller-Toporov (DMT) models, re-analysis of the published experimental data presented in this paper indicates that these models are regularly misused. Additional complication in determination of gamma values using the AFM technique is that the measured pull-off forces have poor reproducibility. Reproducible and meaningful F values can be obtained with strict control over AFM experimental conditions during the pull-off force measurements (low humidity level, controlled and known loads) for high quality substrates and probes (surfaces should be free of heterogeneity, roughness, and contamination). Any probe or substrate imperfections complicate the interpretation of experimental results and often reduce the quality of the generated data. In this review, surface imperfection in terms of roughness and heterogeneity that influence the pull-off force are analyzed based upon the contact mechanics models. Simple correlations are proposed that could guide in selection and preparation of AFM probes and substrates for gamma determination and selection of loading conditions during the pull-off force measurements. Finally, the possibility of AFM measurements of solid surface tension using materials with rough surfaces is discussed.},

abstract = {Different crystallographic planes, at a gas‐metal interface, have different surface energies. Although the energy difference is small (less than 100 erg/cm2), it is sufficient to cause migration of boundaries between grains of different (hkl) surfaces provided there is a sufficiently small restraint to boundary migration. Since the (110) plane is the plane of lowest surface energy $\gamma$ in 3{\%} silicon‐iron, grains with (110) planes at the gas‐metal interface are favored to grow at the expense of other (hkl) grains ($\gamma$110{\textless}$\gamma$hkl) when the material and annealing atmosphere are free of impurities. In the presence of certain impurities, however, $\gamma$100 may be lower than $\gamma$hkl and grains with (100) planes are favored to grow at the expense of all others. With proper processing, sharp (110)[001] or (100)[001] textures may be obtained in sheets of high‐purity silicon‐iron. Grain size and texture can be altered by deliberate additions of oxide film to the surface, by the amount of silicon in the alloy, and by the choice of annealing atmosphere. The effect of improved texture and low impurity concentration on magnetic properties is discussed.},

abstract = {This chapter explores two special interactions, the hydrogen bond and the hydrophobic effect, which are particularly relevant to the interactions of water. Some unusually strong and orientation-dependent bonds are involved in the interactions between water molecules. Hydrogen bonds play a particularly prominent role in water, since each oxygen atom with its two hydrogens can participate in four such linkages with other water molecules: two involving its own H atoms and two involving its unshared (lone-pair) electrons with other H atoms. Computer simulations show that in ice, the molecules order in such a way that each oxygen atom is tetrahedrally coordinated to four other oxygens, with a hydrogen atom lying in the line joining two oxygen atoms. This chapter explains in detail the hydrogen bonding in water molecular. It also introduces models of water and associated liquids. Relative strengths of different types of interactions are also explored in the chapter. The chapter concludes with a discussion on the hydrophotic effect, hydrophotic interaction, and hydrophilic interactions.},

abstract = {The line energy associated with the triple phase contact line is a function of local surface defects (chemical and topographical); however, it can still be calculated from the advancing and receding contact angles to which those defects give rise. In this study an expression for the line energy associated with the triple phase contact line is developed. The expression relates the line energy to the drop volume, the interfacial energies, and the actual contact angle (be it advancing, receding, or in between). From the expression we can back calculate the equilibrium Young contact angle, theta0, as a function of the maximal advancing, thetaA, and minimal receding, thetaR, contact angles. To keep a certain maximal hysteresis between advancing and receding angles, different line energies are required depending on the three interfacial energies and the drop's volume V. We learn from the obtained expressions that the hysteresis is determined by some dimensionless parameter, K, which is some normalized line energy. The value of K required to keep a constant hysteresis (thetaA-thetaR) rises to infinity as we get closer to theta0 = 90 degrees.},

abstract = {Under certain special conditions of processing and annealing,siliconiron can be made to have cubic orientation. This phenomenonwas first reported by Assmus et al. The driving force for the growth of the cubic grains has beendetermined by several investigators to be surface energy. We havefound that by controlling the concentration of impurities in theannealing atmosphere the growth of grains having the (100) planeparallel to the sheet surface can be greatly improved. Calculationsof the surface energies in the body-centered system show that thesurface energy of atomic planes are (110), (100) and (111) inorder of ascending values. From this orientation dependency of thesurface energy, there results a discrepancy between theory and theobserved fact of (100) surface energy growth. It is proposed that adsorption by the metal surface of atmosphereconstituents in a very special manner can accomplish achange in relative surface energy so that the (100) plane becomesthe lowest energy crystal plane. Data on some atmosphere composition effects on transformationto cube texture of siliconiron 2 to 14 mils thick were obtained. The degree of transformation was found to be closely relatedto the concentration of certain compounds that are added to theatmosphere. The degree of cube growth reaches a maximum at acertain small concentration of impurity. These effects were studied in both metal and ceramicannealingtubes. With proper additives excellent cube growth can be obtainedin either type annealing tube.},

A gold film was evaporated on top of the CH(3)NH(3)PbI(3) as a back contact. Importantly, the CH(3)NH(3)PbI(3) nanoparticles assume here simultaneously the roles of both light harvester and hole conductor, rendering superfluous the use of an additional hole transporting material. The simple mesoscopic CH(3)NH(3)PbI(3)/TiO(2) heterojunction solar cell shows impressive photovoltaic performance, with short-circuit photocurrent J(sc)= 16.1 mA/cm(2), open-circuit photovoltage V(oc) = 0.631 V, and a fill factor FF = 0.57, corresponding to a light to electric power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 5.5{\%} under standard AM 1.5 solar light of 1000 W/m(2) intensity. At a lower light intensity of 100W/m(2), a PCE of 7.3{\%} was measured.

abstract = {In this paper, we investigate the influence of sheet thickness on abnormal grain growth and texture development in NbC-added Fe80Al20 alloys (Alfenol) that are being used as sensors. Being able to reduce sensor thickness is found to be an important for parameter for avoiding work-hardening as the sensors deflect. The alloy is rolled to form sheets with a thickness of 0.2, 0.35, and 0.5 mm, and then annealed to develop a 〈100〉 preferred orientation along the longitudinal direction. Whisker-like ribbons of alloy are then cut from the textured sheet with widths of 2, 4 and 6 mm and the performance of cantilevered whiskers evaluated for future use as flow sensors. The net voltage changes in the Hall sensor that converts magnetization change to electrical signal output were proportional to the applied tip force when the 0.2 and 0.35 mm thick whiskers were bent, a trend that was not observed beyond a low tip deflection in the 0.5 mm thick whisker. Of particular interest is that the 0.2 mm thick whisker shows good flexibility to withstand severe bending, whereas plastic deformation occurred in the 0.35 mm thick whisker, resulting in fatigue induced fracture/failure due to work hardening of the material after frequent severe bending.},

In this paper, we report a simple method to remove the oxide layer on the surface of such alloy to recover its nonwetting characteristics, using hydrochloric acid (HCl) vapor. Through the HCl vapor treatment, we successfully restored the nonwetting characteristics of the alloy and suppressed its viscoelasticity. We analyzed the change of surface chemistry before and after the HCl vapor treatment using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and low-energy ion-scattering spectroscopy (LEIS). Results showed that the oxidized surface of the commercial gallium-based alloy Galinstan (Ga(2)O(3) and Ga(2)O) was replaced with InCl(3) and GaCl(3) after the treatment. Surface tension and static contact angle on a Teflon-coated glass of the HCl-vapor-treated Galinstan were measured to be 523.8 mN/m and 152.5°. A droplet bouncing test was successfully carried out to demonstrate the nonwetting characteristics of the HCl-vapor-treated Galinstan. Finally, the stability of the transformed surface of the HCl-vapor-treated Galinstan was investigated by measuring the contact angle and LEIS spectra after reoxidation in an ambient environment.},

abstract = {A systematic study of 3D equilibrium crystal shapes (ECS) can yield important surface energetic quantities, such as step, kink, surface and step–step interaction free energies. Observations of the ECS, especially of flat facets and adjacent vicinal regions, will provide primarily relative step and surface free energies. An advanced goal is to determine absolute step free energies, kink formation and step interaction energies. Absolute values of these energies are important in governing crystal growth morphologies, high temperature phase changes and kinetic processes associated with shape changes. Furthermore, absolute step and kink energies are the key to absolute surface free energies of well defined low-index orientations. We review new experiments where sections of the ECS are monitored as a function of temperature to extract characteristic morphological parameters, yielding absolute surface energetic quantities. Attention will be paid to the question of attaining true 3D equilibrium of an ensemble of crystallites. The special role of scanning tunneling and atomic force microscopies will be stressed. New ways of overcoming the problem of the activation barrier for facet growth (or shrinkage) through the study of dislocated crystallites will be demonstrated. In the general context of 3D crystallites, the study of 2D nano-crystals, in the form of adatom or vacancy islands on extended flat surfaces, will be discussed. In particular, the connection between the temperature dependent shape of 2D islands and the absolute step and kink formation energies of the bounding steps, complementary to facet shape changes of 3D crystallites, has emerged as an important topic of recent research. Finally, high temperature phase changes, such as surface roughening and surface melting, as they have been observed by scanning electron microscopy on 3D crystallites, will be briefly reviewed.},

abstract = {Developments in organic-inorganic lead halide-based perovskite solar cells have been meteoric over the last 2 years, with small-area efficiencies surpassing 15{\%}. We address the fundamental issue of how these cells work by applying a scanning electron microscopy-based technique to cell cross-sections. By mapping the variation in efficiency of charge separation and collection in the cross-sections, we show the presence of two prime high efficiency locations, one at/near the absorber/hole-blocking-layer, and the second at/near the absorber/electron-blocking-layer interfaces, with the former more pronounced. This 'twin-peaks' profile is characteristic of a p-i-n solar cell, with a layer of low-doped, high electronic quality semiconductor, between a p- and an n-layer. If the electron blocker is replaced by a gold contact, only a heterojunction at the absorber/hole-blocking interface remains.},

abstract = {Organic semiconductors employed in solar cells are perfectly stable to solar irradiation provided oxygen content can be kept below 1 ppm. Paradoxically, the state-of-the-art molecular hole-transporter-based solid-state dye-sensitized solar cells only operate efficiently if measured in an atmosphere containing oxygen. Without oxygen, these devices rapidly lose photovoltage and photocurrent and are rendered useless. Clearly this peculiar requirement has detrimental implications to the long term stability of these devices. Through characterizing the solar cells in air and in oxygen-free atmospheres, and considering the device architecture, we identify that direct contact between the metallic cathode and the mesoporous metal oxide photo-anode is responsible for a shunting path through the device. This metal-metal oxide contact forms a Schottky barrier under ambient conditions and the barrier is suitably high so as to prevent significant shunting of the solar cells. However, under light absorption in an anaerobic atmosphere the barrier reduces significantly, opening a low resistance shunting path which dominates the current-voltage characteristics in the solar cell. By incorporating an extra interlayer of insulating mesoporous aluminum oxide, on top of the mesoporous semiconducting metal oxide electrode, we successfully block this shunting path and subsequently the devices operate efficiently in an oxygen-free atmosphere, enabling the possibility of long term stability of solid-state dye-sensitized solar cells.},

The authors considered the liquid absorption and/or retention (swelling) processes responsible for the observed hysteresis. In this paper hysteresis is considered to be due to the liquid film left behind the drop during retreating of its contact line. Using the contact angle hysteresis an approach is suggested for evaluation of the solid surface free energy. Molecular spacing and the film structure are discussed to explain the difference in n-alkanes and n-alcohols behaviour as well as to explain the difference between dispersion free energy ??sd and total surface free energy ??stot of FC-732, as determined from the advancing contact angles and the hysteresis, respectively. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Contrary to our expectation, our results give evidence for a reduced density of deep level defects and point to an increased density of defect levels in resonance with the lower conduction band at GBs. Our findings imply low recombination activity at GBs, and thus can explain the low impact of GBs on the efficiency of chalcopyrite based solar cells.},

abstract = {This chapter explains basic concepts related to solvation, structural, and hydration forces. It is now known that solvation forces depend not only on the properties of the intervening liquid medium but also on the chemical and physical properties of the surfaces. These factors affect the structure that confined liquids adopt between two surfaces, which in turn affects the solvation force. It is difficult to distinguish between a solvation force that arises from the intrinsic properties of the solvent molecules and a surface force that depends on the properties of the surfaces or solute molecules. This chapter begins with a discussion of non-DLVO forces, and proceeds with explaining concepts of molecular ordering at surfaces, interfaces, and in thin films. The chapter explains ordering of spherical molecules between two smooth surfaces. Ordering of nonspherical molecules between structured surfaces is also studied. The chapter explains origin of the oscillatory force that is the main type of solvation force. Experimental measurements and properties of oscillatory forces are presented. The chapter concludes with a discussion on monotonically repulsive hydration forces and attractive hydrophobic forces.},

abstract = {A theory, based on the presence of an adsorbed film in the vicinity of the triple contact line, provides a molecular interpretation of intrinsic hysteresis during the measurement of static contact angles. Static contact angles are measured by placing a sessile drop on top of a flat solid surface. If the solid surface has not been previously in contact with a vapor phase saturated with the molecules of the liquid phase, the solid surface is free of adsorbed liquid molecules. In the absence of an adsorbed film, molecular forces configure an advancing contact angle larger than the static contact angle. After some time, due to an evaporation/adsorption process, the interface of the drop coexists with an adsorbed film of liquid molecules as part of the equilibrium configuration, denoted as the static contact angle. This equilibrium configuration is metastable because the droplet has a larger vapor pressure than the surrounding flat film. As the drop evaporates, the vapor/liquid interface contracts and the apparent contact line moves towards the center of the drop. During this process, the film left behind is thicker than the adsorbed film and molecular attraction results in a receding contact angle, smaller than the equilibrium contact angle.},

abstract = {Many different photovoltaic technologies are being developed for large-scale solar energy conversion. The wafer-based first-generation photovoltaic devices have been followed by thin-film solid semiconductor absorber layers sandwiched between two charge-selective contacts and nanostructured (or mesostructured) solar cells that rely on a distributed heterojunction to generate charge and to transport positive and negative charges in spatially separated phases. Although many materials have been used in nanostructured devices, the goal of attaining high-efficiency thin-film solar cells in such a way has yet to be achieved. Organometal halide perovskites have recently emerged as a promising material for high-efficiency nanostructured devices. Here we show that nanostructuring is not necessary to achieve high efficiencies with this material: a simple planar heterojunction solar cell incorporating vapour-deposited perovskite as the absorbing layer can have solar-to-electrical power conversion efficiencies of over 15 per cent (as measured under simulated full sunlight). This demonstrates that perovskite absorbers can function at the highest efficiencies in simplified device architectures, without the need for complex nanostructures.},

abstract = {We propose a micro energy-harvesting device, using an iron-gallium alloy (Galfenol), capable of generating electrical energy from ambient vibrations. Galfenol is a ductile magnetostrictive material with a high piezomagnetic constant, good machinability, and a large inverse magnetostrictive effect by which magnetization can be varied by mechanical stress. The device consists of two beams of Galfenol combined with iron yokes, coils, and a bias magnet. A bending force applied at the tip of the cantilever yields a flux increase by tensile stress in one beam, and a flux decreases in the other by compression. The time variation of the flux generates a voltage on the wound coils. This energy harvester has advantages over conventional types of device, such as those using piezoelectric materials, with respect to size, and efficiency, and it has high robustness and low electrical impedance. In addition, the structure needs only a low mechanical force to generate electricity. In this paper, the free vibration characteristic to accrue electric energy effectively is examined. From the experimental results, the energy conversion efficiency in the vibration is inverse proportional to the resonant frequency.},

abstract = {Drop shape techniques are widely used for surface tension measurement. As the shape becomes close to spherical, the performance of drop shape techniques deteriorates. A quantitative criterion called shape parameter was previously introduced to quantify the meaning of "well-deformed" drops and "close to spherical" drops. In this paper, a modified definition of the shape parameter that does not depend on the radius of curvature at the drop apex is proposed. Such definition is applicable to different constellations of pendant and sessile drops/bubbles. Dimensional analysis is used to describe similarity in constrained sessile drop shapes and to express the problem using appropriate dimensionless groups. The proposed shape parameter is found to depend only on two dimensionless groups: the dimensionless volume (drop volume normalized by the cube of the holder radius) and the Bond number (using the drop holder's radius as the length scale). A critical shape parameter (minimum value of the shape parameter that guarantees a specified accuracy) is shown to depend only on Bond number. A set of experiments were performed with pure liquids to illustrate the change of the critical shape parameter with the Bond number.},

@article{Rotenberg1983a,
abstract = {A general, yet user-oriented scheme is provided to determine liquid—fluid interfacial tensions and contact angles from the shapes of axisymmetric menisci, i.e., from sessile as well as pendant drops. The strategy employed is to construct an objective function which expresses the error between the physically observed and a theoretical Laplacian curve, i.e., a curve representing a solution of the Laplace equation of capillarity. This objective function is minimized numerically using the method of incremental loading in conjunction with the Newton—Raphson method. This strategy is necessary as the otherwise powerful Newton-Raphson method depends on a good initial approximation to the true curve. Incremental loading provides a scheme of approaching the solution from a remote situation. A spherical meniscus, i.e., the case of infinite interfacial tension, is chosen here as the simple, unloaded solution. The method is set up from the point of view of user convenience: Apart from local gravity and densities of liquid and fluid phases the only input information required to determine the liquid-fluid interfacial tension is information on meniscus shape, typically several coordinate points in a coordinate system the origin of which may be placed at will. Specifically it is not necessary to identify the apex of the drop profile, the drop width, or drop height. For determinations of contact angles, the vertical coordinate of the three-phase line needs to be specified. As an illustration, “synthetic” drops, simulating physical drop profiles, are investigated. Sessile drops are generated with the aid of the tables of Bashforth and Adams and pendant drops with the aid of the tables of Fordham. The results show that the technique, which is an absolute one independent of any tables, is fully functional. A computer program implementing the method may be purchased from the authors.},

abstract = {This chapter explores the unifying concepts in intermolecular and interparticle forces. The chapter explains the association of like molecules or particles in a medium. It shows that independently of the type of interaction force involved, certain semiquantitative relations, known as combining relations, that describe molecular forces are applicable quite generally to all systems, that is, to the interactions of molecules, particles, surfaces, and even complex multicomponent systems. The chapter discusses specific interactions as well as complementary (lock-and-key) interactions, and presents examples to show how such specific interactions can result from the complementary shapes of molecules, in which like molecules cannot fit together, whereas unlike molecules can. The examples also show that specific interactions can be the result of an inherently specific interatomic bond, such as the hydrogen bond. The chapter explains the concepts of surface and interfacial energy, and the association of unlike molecules, particles, or surfaces in a third medium. The chapter also discusses about particle–surface and particle–interface interactions as well as the concepts of engulfing and ejections.},

For liquid metals, they are complicated by the high temperatures and the consequently high reactivity characterising these melts. In particular, oxidation of the liquid surface in combination with evaporation phenomena requires a stringent control of the experimental conditions, and an appropriate theoretical treatment. Recently, much progress has been made on both sides. In addition to improving the conventional sessile drop technique, new containerless methods have been developed for surface tension measurements. This paper reviews the experimental progress made in the last few years, and the theoretical framework required for modelling and understanding the relevant physico-chemical surface phenomena.},

However, the authors have found that there is really a need for a book which can lead an investigator, a student, or a beginn er through the in-depth understanding and descriptions involved in the derivations and usage of the adsorption equations based on the unified concept of the Gibbs surface excess. The derivation of the original Gibbs equation for the liquid interface has been amplified with reformulations and criticisms. Attempts have been frequently made to relate the surface excess quantities with the thermodynamic properties of the physically defined interfacial phase. In the last two decades, useful applications of the Gibbs equations have been made for the study of adsorption at solid-liquid as weIl as liquid-gas interfaces formed in the presence of the multicomponent solutions in the bulk. These recent treatments become useful for the experimental studies of the adsorption of electrolytes and interfacial properties related to neutral and charged monolayers. The consistency of the experimental results with those to be expected from the theories of the electrical double layer needs careful examination. An attempt has been made to present in a single volume all these developments based on the unified concept of the Gibbs surface excess. The study of the adsorption from solution is of considerable importance in the field of biology and in many other branches of applied science.},

It also examines how nonspecific interactions combine to give rise to highly specific interactions, and how they act together in regulating the organization and morphologies of biological structures. The chapter takes into consideration the nonequilibrium or dynamic aspects of these interactions since biological systems are living systems, and their interactions are never at equilibrium, even in the steady state where a constant supply of energy is required. The chapter begins with a discussion on van der Waals, electrostatic, and DLVO forces. It then explains the concepts of repulsive entropic forces, attractive depletion forces, and attractive hydrophobic forces. Interdependence of intermembranes and intramembrane forces in biological membranes and structures is then explained. The chapter concludes with a discussion on membrane fusion and bioadhesion.},

abstract = {The unusual topographies of the grain boundary thermal grooves in Ni-rich NiAl were observed after annealing at 1400°C. One of the surfaces forming the grain boundary groove exhibited no curvature measurable in the atomic force microscope, thus indicating its singular character. The theory of grain boundary grooving at singular surfaces was developed in the small-slope approximation and under assumption of negligible diffusivity on these surfaces. The calculated groove shapes are in good agreement with the experimental data and differ considerably from the shapes predicted by the classical Mullins grooving theory for isotropic surfaces.},

abstract = {The ceramic interface properties and morphology were estimated based on contact angle measurements. The contact angle, $\theta$, was measured using different liquids (glycerol, NaCl 3.5{\%} solution, oleic acid and ultra pure water) with known surface tensions. Correlations of the contact angle with the chemical bonds and morphology of thin films are presented. The thin films, deposited via Spray Pyrolysis Deposition (SPD) are TiO2 (dense, porous) and WO3 (dense, porous) films. The interface properties of the ceramic layers were explained using the topography images obtained with Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), and by measuring the contact angles and surface tensions. The contact angles method is sensitive at high $\theta$ values. The experiments indicated that the recommended testing liquid is pure water, both for TiO2 and WO3 thin films, allowing a clear difference between dense and porous surfaces. The measurements were done at the initial moment of the contact drop-sample and with 1 s step up to 30 min. The presented results can be further used in optimizing the layer-by-layer deposition of thin films.},

The chapter begins with a discussion on surface and interfacial energies. Some commonly used terms are defined followed by deriving useful thermodynamic relations. Conceptual differences between energies and forces, which are particularly manifested in adhesion and wetting phenomena are explained. An overview of the adhesion energies versus adhesion forces is then presented. The chapter introduces the concept of surface energy as the free energy change occurring when the surface area of a medium is increased by unit area. The chapter examines adhesion on highly curved surfaces and interfaces. Differences in the surface energies of droplets and holes are discussed. Surface and interfacial energies of some common substances are given. Concepts of contact angles and wetting films in terms of adhesion are discussed, followed by an explanation of adhesion hysteresis and adhesion of rough and textured surfaces. The chapter concludes with a discussion on plastic deformations and capillary forces.},

abstract = {Perovskite-based solar cells have attracted significant recent interest, with power conversion efficiencies in excess of 15{\%} already superceding a number of established thin-film solar cell technologies. Most work has focused on a methylammonium lead trihalide perovskites, with a bandgaps of 1.55 eV and greater. Here, we explore the effect of replacing the methylammonium cation in this perovskite, and show that with the slightly larger formamidinium cation, we can synthesise formamidinium lead trihalide perovskites with a bandgap tunable between 1.48 and 2.23 eV. We take the 1.48 eV-bandgap perovskite as most suited for single junction solar cells, and demonstrate long-range electron and hole diffusion lengths in this material, making it suitable for planar heterojunction solar cells. We fabricate such devices, and due to the reduced bandgap we achieve high short-circuit currents of {\textgreater}23 mA cm−2, resulting in power conversion efficiencies of up to 14.2{\%}, the highest efficiency yet for solution processed planar heterojunction perovskite solar cells. Formamidinium lead triiodide is hence promising as a new candidate for this class of solar cell.},

abstract = {A new method for the measurement of apparent contact angles at the global energy minimum on real surfaces has been developed. The method consists of vibrating the surface, taking top-view pictures of the drop, monitoring the drop roundness, and calculating the contact angle from the drop diameter and weight. The use of the new method has been demonstrated for various rough surfaces, all having the same surface chemistry. In order to establish the optimal vibration conditions, the proper ranges for the system parameters (i.e., drop volume, vibration time, frequency of vibration, and amplitude of vibration) were determined. The reliability of the method has been demonstrated by the fact that the ideal contact angles of all surfaces, as calculated from the Wenzel equation using the measured apparent contact angles, came out to be practically identical. This ideal contact angle has been compared with three methods of calculation from values of advancing and receding contact angles. ?? 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Fuel cells are uniquely capable of overcoming combustion efficiency limitations (e.g., the Carnot cycle). However, the linking of fuel cells (an energy conversion device) and hydrogen (an energy carrier) has emphasized investment in proton-exchange membrane fuel cells as part of a larger hydrogen economy and thus relegated fuel cells to a future technology. In contrast, solid oxide fuel cells are capable of operating on conventional fuels (as well as hydrogen) today. The main issue for solid oxide fuel cells is high operating temperature (about 800°C) and the resulting materials and cost limitations and operating complexities (e.g., thermal cycling). Recent solid oxide fuel cells results have demonstrated extremely high power densities of about 2 watts per square centimeter at 650°C along with flexible fueling, thus enabling higher efficiency within the current fuel infrastructure. Newly developed, high-conductivity electrolytes and nanostructured electrode designs provide a path for further performance improvement at much lower temperatures, down to {\~{}}350°C, thus providing opportunity to transform the way we convert and store energy.},

In this study, we present results from a proof-of-concept prototype energy harvester that produces an output voltage proportional to the load-induced bending of the galfenol element caused by a base acceleration of the device. The device consists of a polycrystalline galfenol strip bonded to an aluminum cantilever beam, which has an effective length of 35.81 mm. Two brass pieces, each containing a permanent magnet, are used to mass load each end of the beam and to provide a magnetic bias field through the galfenol strip. The voltage induced in an induction coil closely wound around the cantilever beam captures the time rate of change of magnetic flux within the galfenol strip as the beam vibrates. The first bending-mode resonant frequency of the device was 223 Hz. The power generated from the prototype when subjected to a 1g acceleration at 222 Hz was 2.2 mW (root mean square), which corresponded to an efficiency of more than 60{\%} for the electrical power output per unit mechanical power input to the harvester.},

Constitutive relationships are summarized in a table of critical surface tensions of wetting. The theory and application of the retraction method of preparing adsorbed monolayers from solution and the conditions for mixed films are presented. Studies of the wetting behavior of solutions of various surfactants and the resultant explanation of the function of a wetting agent are generalized to include nonaqueous systems. Following estimates of the reversible work of adhesion of liquids to solids, the part played by wetting in obtaining optimum adhesion by adhesives is outlined, and a fundamental explanation is given of constitutive effects in the development of strong adhesive joints.

abstract = {Nanocrystals are fundamental to modern science and technology. Mastery over the shape of a nanocrystal enables control of its properties and enhancement of its usefulness for a given application. The aim of this article is to present a comprehensive review of current research activities that center on the shape-controlled synthesis of metal nanocrystals. We begin with a brief introduction to nucleation and growth within the context of metal nanocrystal synthesis, followed by a discussion of the possible shapes that a metal nanocrystal might take under different conditions. We then focus on a variety of experimental parameters that have been explored to manipulate the nucleation and growth of metal nanocrystals in solution-phase syntheses in an effort to generate specific shapes. We then elaborate on these approaches by selecting examples in which there is already reasonable understanding for the observed shape control or at least the protocols have proven to be reproducible and controllable. Toward the end of this article, we highlight a number of applications that have been enabled and/or enhanced by the shape-controlled synthesis of metal nanocrystals. We conclude this article with personal perspectives on the directions toward which future research in this field might take.},

abstract = {Current concerns regarding greenhouse gas-related environmental effects, energy security, and the rising costs of fossil fuel-based energy has renewed interest in solar energy in general and photovotaics in particular. Exploring state-of-the-art developments from a practical point of view, Nanotechnology for Photovoltaics examines issues in increasing efficiency, decreasing costs, and how these two goals can be achieved in a single photovoltaic device. It provides fundamental background and places research approaches within the proper physical context as related to photovoltaics performance enhancement.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nThe book reviews the applications of devices and their performance requirements, followed by coverage of thin films and advanced band structure concepts for obtaining efficiencies above the Shockley--Queisser single bandgap efficiency limit of {\~{}}31{\%}. The editor and contributors also discuss the basic optical properties of nanostructured materials as related to photovoltaics applications and describes nanoscale optoelectronic device physics related to performance. They then explore recent literature in the application of various classes of nanostructures to photovoltaics. The book covers solar cells based on hybrid organic-inorganic nanocomposites structures, quantum wells, nanowires/tubes, and quantum dots. It also discusses the use of nanoparticles/quantum dots to enhance the performance of conventional solar cells and luminescent solar concentrators.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nEach chapter summarizes the historical development for the nanostructure class under consideration, applications beyond photovoltaics, and the major synthetic methods, followed by a critique of leading works that have employed the particular nanostructure type. The book examines the advantages of each nanostructure approach and the remaining technical challenges, with an emphasis on possible future areas of research interest. It concludes with a summary of the major processing approaches and challenges of using the various nanostructures to photovoltaics applications, focusing on future scale-up and nanomanufactuting issues. Many books cover photovoltaics and many others nanotechnology --- it is the coverage of both in one resource that sets this book apart.},

abstract = {Organolead trihalide perovskite materials have been successfully used as light absorbers in efficient photovoltaic cells. Two different cell structures, based on mesoscopic metal oxides and planar heterojunctions have already demonstrated very impressive advances in performance. Here, we report a bilayer architecture comprising the key features of mesoscopic and planar structures obtained by a fully solution-based process. We used CH3NH3 Pb(I1 - xBrx)3 (x = 0.1-0.15) as the absorbing layer and poly(triarylamine) as a hole-transporting material. The use of a mixed solvent of $\gamma$-butyrolactone and dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO) followed by toluene drop-casting leads to extremely uniform and dense perovskite layers via a CH3NH3I-PbI2-DMSO intermediate phase, and enables the fabrication of remarkably improved solar cells with a certified power-conversion efficiency of 16.2{\%} and no hysteresis. These results provide important progress towards the understanding of the role of solution-processing in the realization of low-cost and highly efficient perovskite solar cells.},

abstract = {The effects of substitutional and interstitial additions on uniaxial anisotropy (Kuni) generated via stress annealing were investigated for the galfenol (Fe-Ga) alloy system. Polycrystalline samples prepared via free stand zone melt directional solidification technique were tested under pre- and post-stress annealed conditions in order to ascertain the extent of the built-in stress (Tbuilt-in) created. Energy based modeling utilizing magnetostriction and magnetization data was used to determine Kuni and Tbuilt-in. Differential magnetomechanical properties; d33 and $\mu$r were estimated using the same model. Carbon additions from a Fe-C master alloy resulted in Kuni and Tbuilt-in values of 12.1 kJ/m3 and 55 MPa, comparable to the binary system. Low carbon steel additions resulted in a minor decrease in Kuni to 9.6 kJ/m3, but still had high Tbuilt-in values of 54 MPa. Aluminum additions exhibited the largest decreases in Kuni and Tbuilt-in. A linear decrease in both values was observed as a function of increasing aluminum content. Kuni values for Fe81.6Ga13.8Al4.6 and Fe81.6Ga9.2Al9.2 alloys were 6.7 and 4.2 kJ/m3, respectively. Tbuilt-in values for Fe81.6Ga13.8Al4.6 and Fe81.6Ga9.2Al9.2 alloys were 37 and 24 MPa, respectively. Estimated d33 and $\mu$r values ranged from 2.0 to 2.7×10-8 m/A and 120-170 for all compositions studied.},

Two similarly charged surfaces usually repel each other electrostatically in solution, though under certain conditions they may attract at small separations. Zwitterionic surfaces, characterized by surface dipoles but with no net charge, also interact electrostatically with each other, though the force is usually attractive. In complex systems, long-range electrostatic forces are involved. This chapter begins with a discussion on the charging of surfaces in liquids. It then explains the charged surfaces in water and the Poisson–Boltzmann equation. The chapter proceeds with a discussion of origin of the ionic distribution, electric field, surface potential, and pressure. Limit of large separations and limit of small separations are explained in detail. A study of electronic double-layer interaction forces and energies between various particle surfaces is then presented. Exact solutions for constant charge and constant potential interactions are then discussed. Concepts of asymmetric surfaces, ion-condensation and ion-correlation forces are reviewed. The DLVO theory for van der Waals and double-layer forces is explained. The chapter concludes with a discussion on experimental measurements of double-layer and DLVO forces.},

abstract = {Perovskite-based solar cells have recently been catapulted to the cutting edge of thin-film photovoltaic research and development because of their promise for high-power conversion efficiencies and ease of fabrication. Two types of generic perovskites compounds have been used in cell fabrication: either Pb- or Sn-based. Here, we describe the performance of perovskite solar cells based on alloyed perovskite solid solutions of methylammonium tin iodide and its lead analogue (CH3NH3Sn(1-x)Pb(x)I3). We exploit the fact that, the energy band gaps of the mixed Pb/Sn compounds do not follow a linear trend (the Vegard's law) in between these two extremes of 1.55 and 1.35 eV, respectively, but have narrower bandgap ({\textless}1.3 eV), thus extending the light absorption into the near-infrared ({\~{}}1,050 nm). A series of solution-processed solid-state photovoltaic devices using a mixture of organic spiro-OMeTAD/lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide/pyridinium additives as hole transport layer were fabricated and studied as a function of Sn to Pb ratio. Our results show that CH3NH3Sn(0.5)Pb(0.5)I3 has the broadest light absorption and highest short-circuit photocurrent density {\~{}}20 mA cm(-2) (obtained under simulated full sunlight of 100 mW cm(-2)).},

It has been found that grain growth takes place at temperatures above 600 ° C . The activation energy for grain growth in a disordered state at 820 ° C is about 57.4±0.5 kcal/mole. The effect of grain size on magnetic properties has been singled out by keeping the same ordering parameter (S=0 and 0.88) for all samples studied. Microstructural characterization and magnetic measurements indicate that the grain size significantly affects the magnetic coercivity. A linear relationship between the coercivity and the reciprocal of the grain size has been universally found regardless of the heat-treatment histories. Lorenz microscopic observation demonstrates that grain boundaries act as pinning sites for the magnetic domain wall movement.},

Conditions required for formation of aggregates are then discussed. The chapter elaborates effect of dimensionality and geometry on self-assembly. It presents a comparison study between infinite aggregates (phase separation) versus finite sized aggregates (micellization). The chapter formulates the basic equations of self-assembly in general statistical thermodynamic terms and then goes on to investigate the relevant intermolecular interactions that determine into which structures different amphiphiles will assemble. The chapter proceeds with discussing the role of molecular geometry in determining the structures formed. The chapter investigates how the geometric shape constraints of surfactant and lipid molecules restrict their assembly into aggregates of different shapes. The chapter concludes that once the aggregates' shape is known, many of their physical properties can be determined with the help of thermodynamic equations. Example of a dilute dispersion of (one-component) cylindrical micelles is given in support of this statement.},

abstract = {The objective of this work was to study the acid–base properties of wood, poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC), nylon 6 and 6,6 by wetting and inverse gas chromatography (IGC) analyses. Information about the acid–base characteristics of these materials should be useful to improve the intermolecular bonding properties in wood-plastic composites. The acid–base properties of pine wood veneers, PVC and nylon 6,6 were determined by contact angle analysis using the work of adhesion (or Fowkes), van Oss–Chaudhury–Good (vOCG) and Chang–Qin–Chen (CQC) approaches. The IGC analysis was performed on maple wood, PVC and nylon 6 particles, and was carried out at infinite dilution using a series of both non-polar and polar acid–base probe gases. The contact angle analysis of the wood veneers using both the work of adhesion and the vOCG approaches showed that the presence of wood extractives was the dominant factor influencing the acid–base properties of the veneers. Particularly, it was shown that aging of non-extracted veneers i...},

abstract = {The interfacial energies between alpha and gamma iron were calculated for Kurdjumov-Sachs (K-S), Nishiyama-Wassermann (N-W), and one orientation relationship (OR), which may represent irrational OR, with varying interface orientation. The relaxation of atomic Structure in the vicinity of the interface was performed by the Monte Carlo method using an embedded atom method (EAM) potential. Whereas the polar plot of calculated interfacial energies exhibited small and large Cusps for the K-S and N-W ORs, an almost equiaxed energy surface with shallow cusps was obtained for the irrational ORs. The equilibrium shape of an alpha particle, N-W oriented with the gamma matrix, was a thick rectangular plate with broad facets containing monatomic ledges. In contrast, the equilibrium shape of alpha particle, K-S oriented with the gamma matrix, was elongated nearly in the closed-packed directions with {\{}112{\}}(gamma) type and another broad facet that achieves relatively good thatching. The volume of these shapes in the Wulff space tends to be smaller for K-S than that of the N-W OR. The equilibrium shape of the grain boundary alpha particle at the gamma grain boundary was calculated under the assumption that the alpha particle has K-S OR with one of the two gamma grains using the modified Wulff construction proposed earlier. The variation of the shape of the alpha particle with gamma grain boundaries at an early stage of precipitation may primarily be ascribed to the change in the variant of the smallest nucleation activation energy and less prominently to the change in the gamma grain boundary energy.},

@book{Israelachvili2011c,
abstract = {This chapter introduces a number of simple but important thermodynamic relations and then illustrates how these thermodynamic relations, when taken together with the strengths of intermolecular forces, determine the properties of a system of molecules. Intermolecular forces can be categorized in a variety of ways. Some forces are purely electrostatic in origin, arising from the Coulomb force between charges. The interactions among charges, ions, permanent dipoles, quadrupoles, and so forth fall into this category. Electrostatic forces include polarization interactions that arise from the dipole moments induced in atoms and molecules by the electric fields of nearby charges and permanent dipoles. All electrostatic interactions in a solvent medium involve polarization effects. The electrostatic forces between electroneutral molecules or assemblies that are free to mutually orient are generally attractive, and they occur even at zero temperature. This chapter addresses the thermodynamic implications arising from the existence of interaction potentials. The chapter proceeds with a discussion of the role of intermolecular interactions in determining equations of state, starting with an analysis of vapor-liquid equilibrium. The chapter discusses the distribution of molecules and particles in systems at equilibrium. The criterion of the thermal energy for gauging the strength of an interaction is also explored in this chapter.},

@article{Olabi2008,
abstract = {Magnetostriction is the change in shape of materials under the influence of an external magnetic field. The cause of magnetostriction change in length is the result of the rotation of small magnetic domains. This rotation and re-orientation causes internal strains in the material structure. The strains in the structure lead to the stretching (in the case of positive magnetostriction) of the material in the direction of the magnetic field. During this stretching process the cross-section is reduced in a way that the volume is kept nearly constant. The size of the volume change is so small that it can be neglected under normal operating conditions. Applying a stronger field leads to stronger and more definite re-orientation of more and more domains in the direction of magnetic field. When all the magnetic domains have become aligned with the magnetic field the saturation point has been achieved. This paper presents the state of the art of the magnetostrictive materials and their applications such as: Reaction Mass Actuator, A standard Terfenol-D Actuator, Linear Motor Based on Terfenol-D (Worm Motor), Terfenol-D in Sonar Transducers, Terfenol-D Wireless Rotational Motor, Terfenol-D Electro-Hydraulic Actuator, Wireless Linear Micro-Motor, Magnetostrictive Film Applications, Magnetostrictive Contactless Torque Sensors and many other applications.

abstract = {CeO2 samples doped with 10, 1.0, and 0.1 mol{\%} Y2O3 and undoped CeO2 samples of high purity were studied by impedance spectroscopy at temperatures {\textless}800degreesC and under various oxygen partial pressures. According to microstructural investigations by SEM and analytical STEM (equipped with EDXS), the grain boundaries were free of any second phase, providing direct grain-to-grain contacts. An amorphous siliceous phase was detected at only a few triple junctions, if at all; as a result, its contribution to the grain-boundary resistance was negligible. Nevertheless, the specific grain-boundary conductivities were still 2-7 orders of magnitude lower than the bulk conductivities, depending on dopant concentration, temperature, and oxygen partial pressure. The charge carrier transport across the grain boundaries occurred only through the grain-to-grain contacts, whose properties were then determined by the space-charge layer. The space-charge potential in acceptor-doped CeO2 was positive, causing the simultaneous depletion of oxygen vacancies and accumulation of electrons in the space-charge layer. The very low grain-boundary conductivities can be accounted for by the oxygen-vacancy depletion; the accumulation of electrons became evident in weakly doped and undoped CeO2 at high temperatures and under low oxygen partial pressures.},

In particular, NEMS oscillators have been proposed for use in ultrasensitive mass detection, radio-frequency signal processing, and as a model system for exploring quantum phenomena in macroscopic systems. Perhaps the ultimate material for these applications is a carbon nanotube. They are the stiffest material known, have low density, ultrasmall cross-sections and can be defect-free. Equally important, a nanotube can act as a transistor and thus may be able to sense its own motion. In spite of this great promise, a room-temperature, self-detecting nanotube oscillator has not been realized, although some progress has been made. Here we report the electrical actuation and detection of the guitar-string-like oscillation modes of doubly clamped nanotube oscillators. We show that the resonance frequency can be widely tuned and that the devices can be used to transduce very small forces.},

It is generally accepted that magnetization reversal should be driven by a stimulus represented by time-non-invariant vectors such as a magnetic field, spin-polarized electric current, or cross-product of two oscillating electric fields. However, until now it has been generally assumed that heating alone, not represented as a vector at all, cannot result in a deterministic reversal of magnetization, although it may assist this process. Here we show numerically and demonstrate experimentally a novel mechanism of deterministic magnetization reversal in a ferrimagnet driven by an ultrafast heating of the medium resulting from the absorption of a sub-picosecond laser pulse without the presence of a magnetic field.},

Line scans through high symmetry ???110??? azimuths are transformed into an anisotropic relative surface free energy, ??(??,T). The absolute surface free energy of Pb(111) is obtained from the limiting slopes, df(??,T)/d tan??, of the orientation dependent f(??,T) = ??(??,T)/ cos?? at the boundaries of the (111) facet, located at ??=0??. This value is 25.7??1.4 meV/??2 or 440??22 mJ/m2. Absolute surface free energies of other low-index orientations, such as (100), (110) etc. are calculated from the relative anisotropy of ??(??)/??(111).

Free energies of steps bounding other facets, such as (100), (110), (112), (113) and (221), are evaluated in the [011??] zone, using the corresponding facet radii and the absolute surface free energies of those facets. ?? 2002 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract = {Successful transfer printing of aluminum (Al), copper (Cu), silver (Ag), nickel (Ni) and gold (Au) films is demonstrated. Previously, Al, Cu, Ag, and Ni films have exhibited relatively strong adhesion to silicon (Si) substrates resulting in poor transfer printing results. To overcome this limitation, Si wafers were coated with parylene C before metals deposition. Surface energy calculations determined from contact angle measurements confirm parylene's suitability for the transfer printing process. Metal films were photolithographically patterned onto parylene C coated Si wafers and then transfer printed onto either polyethylene naphthalene (PEN), polycarbonate (PC) or Kapton substrates. Resistance measurements were taken both before and after printing. Calculated resistivity values were close to bulk materials and no significant drop in resistivity was observed after printing, indicating that the printed metal films are of high quality. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.

@article{McHale2007,
abstract = {The properties of superhydrophobic surfaces are often understood by reference to the Cassie-Baxter and Wenzel equations. Recently, in a paper deliberately entitled to be provocative, it has been suggested that these equations are wrong; a suggestion said to be justified using experimental data. In this paper, we review the theoretical basis of the equations. We argue that these models are not so much wrong as have assumptions that define the limitations on their applicability and that with suitable generalization they can be used with surfaces possessing some types of spatially varying defect distributions. We discuss the relationship of the models to the previously published experiments and using minimum energy considerations review the derivations of the equations for surfaces with defect distributions. We argue that this means the roughness parameter and surface area fractions are quantities local to the droplet perimeter and that the published data can be interpreted within the models. We derive versions of the Cassie-Baxter and Wenzel equations involving roughness and Cassie-Baxter solid fraction functions local to the three-phase contact line on the assumption that the droplet retains an average axisymmetry shape. Moreover, we indicate that, for superhydrophobic surfaces, the definition of droplet perimeter does not necessarily coincide with the three-phase contact line. As a consequence, the three-phase contact lines within the contact perimeter beneath the droplet can be important in determining the observed contact angle on superhydrophobic surfaces.},

abstract = {Wetting theory is discussed with particular application to the waterproofing of textile fabrics. Modifications of the equations for wetting of smooth solid surfaces required to adapt them to rough solid surfaces are considered. The equation A = S1 - S12 = S2 cos $\theta$, in which A is adhesion tension, S1 and S2 are surface tensions of solid and liquid, resp., S12 is interfactial tension, and $\theta$ angle of contact, becomes for rough surfaces r A = r(S1 - S12) = S2 cos $\theta$ in which r is the roughness factor defined as the ratio between the actual surface and the geometric surface. The geometric surface is the surface measured in the plane of the interface. The product r A is called the effective adhesion tension. A convenient and dependable exptl. method for measuring the wetting of different solids by the same liquid is described. It is based on the tilting-plate method of measuring contact angles. Effective adhesion tensions for various waxes, gums, metallic soaps and other compds. are reported. Twenty-two references. [on SciFinder(R)]},

abstract = {This chapter explores electrostatic interactions involving molecular polarization. Molecular polarization involves the dipole moments induced in molecules by the electric fields emanating from nearby molecules. For a nonpolar molecule, the polarizability arises from the displacement of its negatively charged electron cloud relative to the positively charged nucleus under the influence of an external electric field. The chapter lists the electronic polarizabilities of some common atoms and molecules. Since the electronic polarizability is associated with displacements of electron clouds, it is recognized that the polarizability of a molecule can be obtained by simply summing the characteristic polarizabilities of its covalent bonds. The chapter shows that apart from the purely Coulombic interaction between two charges or permanent dipoles in a vacuum, all other interactions are essentially polarization type interactions. The effects of polarization on electrostatic interactions are summarized in the chapter. The chapter concludes with a discussion on interactions between ions and uncharged molecules.},

abstract = {Cold, macroscopic mechanical systems are expected to behave contrary to our usual classical understanding of reality; the most striking and counterintuitive predictions involve the existence of states in which the mechanical system is located in two places simultaneously. Various schemes have been proposed to generate and detect such states, and all require starting from mechanical states that are close to the lowest energy eigenstate, the mechanical ground state. Here we report the cooling of the motion of a radio-frequency nanomechanical resonator by parametric coupling to a driven, microwave-frequency superconducting resonator. Starting from a thermal occupation of 480 quanta, we have observed occupation factors as low as 3.8 +/- 1.3 and expect the mechanical resonator to be found with probability 0.21 in the quantum ground state of motion. Further cooling is limited by random excitation of the microwave resonator and heating of the dissipative mechanical bath. This level of cooling is expected to make possible a series of fundamental quantum mechanical observations including direct measurement of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle and quantum entanglement with qubits.},

@article{Doudrick2014,
abstract = {Gallium-based liquid metals are of interest for a variety of applications including flexible electronics, soft robotics, and biomedical devices. Still, nano- to microscale device fabrication with these materials is challenging because, despite having surface tension 10 times higher than water, they strongly adhere to a majority of substrates. This unusually high adhesion is attributed to the formation of a thin oxide shell; however, its role in the adhesion process has not yet been established. In this work, we demonstrate that, dependent on dynamics of formation and resulting morphology of the liquid metal-substrate interface, GaInSn adhesion can occur in two modes. The first mode occurs when the oxide shell is not ruptured as it makes contact with the substrate. Because of the nanoscale topology of the oxide surface, this mode results in minimal adhesion between the liquid metal and most solids, regardless of substrate's surface energy or texture. In the second mode, the formation of the GaInSn-substrate interface involves rupturing of the original oxide skin and formation of a composite interface that includes contact between the substrate and pieces of old oxide, bare liquid metal, and new oxide. We demonstrate that in this latter mode GaInSn adhesion is dominated by the intimate contact between new oxide and substrate. We also show that by varying the pinned contact line length using varied degrees of surface texturing, the adhesion of GaInSn in this mode can be either decreased or increased. Lastly, we demonstrate how these two adhesion modes limit microcontact printing of GaInSn patterns but can be exploited to repeatedly print individual sub-200 nm liquid metal drops.},
